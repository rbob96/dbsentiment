Its collection presentations have always featured a broad range of models \u2014 of different races, sizes and physical abilities \u2014 and are never without a sense of humor.

Mr. Woodhouse worked at the Democratic National Committee when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, and saw Democrats struggle to discuss it in the years afterward. \u201cBut every poll we take, it\u2019s the issue that\u2019s most important to people.\u201d\n\nThe newfound Democratic health care enthusiasm may not translate into victories, of course. Republican campaigns are turning away from health care as a major issue this cycle, planning to pay more attention to other messages like immigration, job creation and attacks on Democrats. When they talk about health care, many candidates are focusing on Democratic efforts to expand public health insurance coverage, not on continued calls to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to vote with their pocketbooks, and the strong economic performance will be at the forefront of every discussion this fall,\u201d said Jesse Hunt , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee , adding, \u201cA contrast between single-payer health care and our ideas \u2014 a more patient-centered approach \u2014 is a debate we fully welcome.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans are sticking to the old anti-Obamacare script. In Missouri, Ms. McCaskill\u2019s expected opponent, Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, talks about health care frequently. \u201cI talk about Obamacare and just the broken health care system,\u201d he said, noting that the rising cost of health insurance is one of several factors eroding middle-class security.\n\nTwo main changes appear to have turned the tide on health care as an issue. The Republican effort to repeal Obamacare last year made the embattled health law more popular than it has ever been. For the first time, the Affordable Care Act earned the support of a majority of Americans in public polls, a small shift but one that has been durable, even as Congress moved on to a tax overhaul and other issues. Pre-existing condition protections have always been much more popular than the law over all.\n\nThe threat of repeal appears to have been particularly galvanizing for Democratic activists, who came out to protest and contact their legislators during the debate.\n\nThe second change came more recently, when the Trump administration decided not to defend Obamacare from a lawsuit brought by the Republican attorneys general of 20 states. The lawsuit argues that the entire law should be invalidated as unconstitutional. The Trump administration\u2019s position is that most of the law should remain on the books, but that its protections for people with pre-existing illnesses should be stripped away.", "sentiment": 0.28528749999999997, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "After Years of Quiet, Democratic Candidates Can\u2019t Stop Talking About Health Care"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/world/europe/pope-death-penalty.html", "text": "ROME \u2014 Pope Francis has declared the death penalty wrong in all cases, a definitive change in church teaching that is likely to challenge Catholic politicians, judges and officials who have argued that their church was not entirely opposed to capital punishment.\n\nBefore, church doctrine accepted the death penalty if it was \u201cthe only practicable way\u201d to defend lives, an opening that some Catholics took as license to support capital punishment in many cases.\n\nBut Francis said executions were unacceptable in all cases because they are \u201can attack\u201d on human dignity, the Vatican announced on Thursday, adding that the church would work \u201cwith determination\u201d to abolish capital punishment worldwide.\n\nFrancis added the change to the Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, the book of doctrine that is taught to Catholic children worldwide and studied by adults in a church with 1.2 billion members.

A HARD R rating would seem to be between \u201cR\u201d \u2014 which has meant restricted to adults, because of various elements \u2014 and \u201cNC-17.\u201d It doesn\u2019t look like the HARD R rating appears on posters and listings for filmgoers; it\u2019s more to do with advertisers who are nervous (in this day and age! imagine) about associating themselves with risqu\u00e9 stuff.\n\nBefore the ratings system was the Hays Code, which was applied to hundreds of films during Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age. Before that there were actual censors, who disallowed the showing of certain material in early movie theaters. In 1917, Margaret Sanger made a drama/documentary about birth control that was censored at the very last minute in New York, and wound up being screened exactly once.\n\n81A: I initially took issue to the definition here, for \u201cRuffian.\u201d I always think of the filly who dominated horse racing in the \u201970s and came to such a tragic end.

When we started on the letter \u201cE,\u201d we felt a lack of challenge and newness. So rather than drop \u201cE,\u201d the second vowel of the alphabet, we chose to exclude another vowel altogether. That was perfect because we found a revealer that was spelled from only \u201clegal\u201d letters \u2014 EYELESS. And to up the ante, we opted to exclude the same vowel not only from the theme words \u2014 but from the whole puzzle! Well, here\u2019s what happens when you do that: You search through the enormous heap of words from your word.lst and delete all words that have the verboten letter, so only \u201clegal\u201d words make up your word.lst. Guess what? Much to my shock, the word catalog shrank more than 50 percent! There were no longer 232,051 words to choose (from Jeff\u2019s magnum word.lst). There were only 110,452. (Gulp!) After the puzzle was complete, we reasoned: \u201cWhat the he ck! Why not exclude the verboten vowel from the clues as well?\u201d Took me aback what a challenge that turned out to be too. Can\u2019t say enough about Jeff. How lucky for me to have found such a collaborator. P.S.: Sorry about the awkward language style of these notes. My keyboard\u2019s tough to use because of that one broken key. Maybe replacement should be next on my personal agenda. JEFF CHEN: Fun to work with Sande on this one! When I collaborate with a newer constructor, I often end up doing the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of the grid layout and filling, but not this time.

Most of my efforts were just in pointing out problematic spots, and giving suggestions on some piece of long fill that might work better than others.

He finds self-help books not just \u201cineffectual\u201d but \u201codorous.\u201d Along those same lines, he expresses disappointment in Samuel Beckett for writing \u201cFail better,\u201d the line of his most likely to be quoted by aspirational writers on social media. \u201cThe therapeutic function soon gets the better of us all,\u201d Thacker laments.", "sentiment": 0.045557142857142886, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Finding Alarm and Consolation About the Apocalypse in Two New Books"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/democrats-midterm-identity-crisis.html", "text": "From 2016 to 2018, the percentage of voters describing Democratic candidates as \u201cin the mainstream\u201d fell from 48 percent to 33 percent. The percentage describing Democratic candidates as \u201cout of step with most Americans\u2019 thinking\u201d rose from 42 percent to 56 percent.\n\nOver the same period, the evaluation of Republican candidates remained virtually unchanged, 59 percent \u201cout of step\u201d in 2016 and 56 percent in 2018; 31 percent \u201cin the mainstream\u201d in 2016, 33 percent in 2018. In other words, over the past two years voters have become substantially more distrustful of the Democratic Party.\n\nI asked political scientists who study political parties for their evaluation of the dual function of the Democratic Party. Their responses varied widely.\n\nRyan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, wrote back to say that one \u201cproblem the party seems to have is that it can\u2019t accommodate all social justice demands at once.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the party became \u201can advocate for urban areas and racial minorities,\u201d Enos argued, but then\n\nslowly, over time, it has become less of an advocate for rural areas, union members, and other things associated with the white working class. This left a portion of the social justice agenda on the table for another party to capture and part of that capture was the election of Trump.\n\nMorris Fiorina, a political scientist at Stanford and the author of \u201cCulture War? The Myth of a Polarized America,\u201d expressed his substantial agreement in an email:\n\nIn my father\u2019s time the modern Democratic Party emphasized reducing economic inequality \u2014 making working people better off. Over time the relative emphasis shifted as the importance of inclusiveness/diversity/identity grew. This happened in concert with the rise of a \u2018new class\u2019 that was relatively more economically secure and obviously created a more divisive agenda.\n\nFiorina drew my attention to the book \u201cRights Talk: The Impoverishment of Political Discourse,\u201d by Mary Ann Glendon, a law professor at Harvard, who, he said, argued\n\nthat making so many policy issues into matters of rights and taking them to the courts was counterproductive. It put opponents in the position of denying other people their rights. The latter are more difficult to compromise because if it\u2019s a right, compromise is an abrogation of it.\n\nFiorina pointed to\n\nthe anger my working class steelworker friends expressed about the concept of \u201cwelfare rights.\u201d Welfare is charity; no one has a right to it was their view. This was the transformation of an issue that previously would have been seen as an economic redistribution issue into what would be considered a social justice issue.\n\nFiorina\u2019s example shows how what can be seen as \u201crights\u201d for one constituency can be seen as \u201ccosts\u201d for another.\n\nFiorina cited the results of the 2016 Voter Study Group Survey of 8000 adults to argue that Democratic elites have adopted a set of issue priorities that are significantly different from those of all voters.\n\nThe Voter Study Group identifies 15 percent of voters who fit into what it calls the Democratic-Independent Liberal Elite category. This is the cohort that has often provided leadership for the social justice movement within the Democratic Party. Members of this group have generally been younger, more liberal, better educated and more affluent than average voters.", "sentiment": 0.15848636363636365, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Opinion | The Democratic Party Picked an Odd Time to Have an Identity Crisis"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/deripaska-sanctions-russia-manafort.html", "text": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is considering lifting the sanctions altogether because they are punishing the \u201chardworking people of Rusal.\u201d But Mr. Mnuchin has it backward. If he was truly concerned about Rusal\u2019s 61,000 employees, he would not relent until the company fully washed its hands of Mr. Deripaska and the corrupt regime the aluminum giant serves.\n\nBehind Mr. Deripaska\u2019s estimated fortune of as much as $5.3 billion, there stands a great crime. During the \u201caluminum wars\u201d of the 1990s, when that economic sector was consolidating in the chaotic privatization that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the young metals trader was suspected of ties to gangsters as he seized control of huge Siberian smelters. According to testimony by a gang member in Stuttgart, Germany, part of Mr. Deripaska\u2019s value to the group were his links to Russia\u2019s security services. While his rivals were killed off or fled Russia, Mr. Deripaska somehow emerged as the director general of Rusal, a company that reported revenues last year of nearly $10 billion. But suspicions that the oligarch has had links to organized crime have denied him a visa to enter the United States.\n\nMr. Deripaska is little more than a trustee for his aluminum concern. In Russia, oligarchs like him owe their wealth and status to the Kremlin. In return, they must do its bidding, which in Mr. Deripaska\u2019s case meant spending more than $1 billion, through his holding company, on new infrastructure for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Deripaska has embraced his role, stating that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. In line with that conceit, a memo obtained by The Associated Press showed that Mr. Manafort tried to pitch him a plan for an influence campaign to \u201cgreatly benefit the Putin government.\u201d\n\nMr. Deripaska was sanctioned on April 6 by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control for \u201chaving acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the government of the Russian Federation.\u201d Also sanctioned were Rusal and the publicly traded holding company that controls it, En+. The sanctions caused Rusal\u2019s share price to plummet by 50 percent and roiled the global aluminum market. Mr. Deripaska soon announced that he would relinquish control of Rusal and resigned from the boards of En+ and Rusal.", "sentiment": 0.02162857142857144, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Opinion | Another Gift for a Putin Buddy"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/reader-center/free-range-parenting-outside-united-states.html", "text": "Image Credit Eleni Kalorkoti\n\nA mother in Sweden says she often didn\u2019t know where her elementary-school-aged son went for the afternoon after school.\n\nA father in Paris says he sends his daughters outside to the playground nearby \u2014 alone.\n\nAnd a mother in the Netherlands says parents don\u2019t feel compelled to stick around for children\u2019s birthday parties \u2014 they drop off their little ones, and then leave to run their errands.\n\nIn much of the world, parents tend to regard such free-range parenting practices as developing a child\u2019s self-reliance.

Her approach to entertaining is no less fluid.\n\nSince launching the label in 2011 with her co-designer Mike Eckhaus, Latta, 30, has rightfully been touted as an icon of today\u2019s fashion avant-garde.

And while the chances of passing any legislation in an election year are dim, the proposal introduces a new strain of thinking about what Social Security can be used for. Another legislator, Representative Thomas Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, recently introduced a bill that would let individuals draw Social Security benefits early to pay off a portion of their student loans.\n\nMillions of retirees rely on modest checks from the program, which was created from a bill signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. Treating Social Security as something that can be borrowed against suggests that it can be treated as an individual account rather than a social insurance program. That could open the door to privatizing the accounts, some experts said, an idea that was floated during George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant philosophy shift that doesn\u2019t look at it like an insurance program where we are all in it together, but an individual asset you can tap to pay for your individual needs,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThe proposal would also begin to reshape Social Security into something more akin to 401(k) accounts: Account holders can borrow against their 401(k), or even drain it in a financial emergency (albeit with a penalty), leaving them with less savings for retirement.\n\nSocial Security, in contrast, cannot be touched and is often viewed as the last standing leg in the three-legged stool of retirement, when personal savings are not enough and pensions are increasingly rare.\n\nTo be eligible for the proposed program, a new parent would need to have a minimum amount of earnings in the years before claiming the benefit, similar to the formula used to qualify for Social Security disability benefits , according to the proposal from the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\n\nThe size of the benefit would be calculated borrowing a formula from Social Security. A 26-year-old woman earning $31,000, for example, might receive roughly $1,175 a month in Social Security parental benefits, which replaces about 45 percent of her income, for up to 12 weeks.", "sentiment": 0.4417583333333333, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Why a Republican Plan for Paid Leave Has Stirred Concern About Social Security"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "http://cn.nytimes.com/china/20180802/taiwan-oslo-freedom-forum/", "text": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u963b\u6b62\u53f0\u6e7e\u52a0\u5165\u8bb8\u591a\u56fd\u9645\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5bf9\u540e\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u573a\u8bba\u575b\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u56fd\u9645\u8ba4\u53ef\u2014\u2014\u6765\u81ea\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u5f02\u89c1\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u5018\u82e5\u4e0d\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u8bdd\u3002\u53cd\u5bf9\u515a\u56fd\u6c11\u515a\u7acb\u59d4\u8bb8\u6bd3\u4ec1\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u575b\u5c06\u7a81\u51fa\u53f0\u6e7e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8be5\u5730\u533a\u6c11\u4e3b\u5178\u8303\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\n\n\u201c\u53f0\u6e7e\u4e3a\u4e86\u6c11\u4e3b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u3001\u8270\u82e6\u7684\u6597\u4e89\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u65bd\u538b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4eca\u5929\u4ecd\u5728\u4e3a\u6c11\u4e3b\u800c\u594b\u6597\uff0c\u201d\u53c2\u4e0e\u628a\u8fd9\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u5e26\u5230\u53f0\u6e7e\u7684\u8bb8\u6bd3\u4ec1\u8bf4\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u5206\u4eab\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u201d\n\n\u8be5\u8bba\u575b\u7531\u603b\u90e8\u8bbe\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u7684\u4eba\u6743\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a(Human Rights Foundation)\u4e3b\u529e\uff0c\u81ea2009\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u6bcf\u5e74\u90fd\u5728\u5965\u65af\u9646\u4e3e\u884c\u300210\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u5b83\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u57ce\u548c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u5185\u65af\u5821\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4e3e\u529e\u8fc7\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4e3e\u529e\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n\n\u5728\u53f0\u5317\u81ea\u7531\u5e7f\u573a\u60ac\u6302\u53f0\u6e7e\u56fd\u65d7\u7684\u58eb\u5175\u3002 \u4e2d\u56fd\u58f0\u79f0\u53f0\u6e7e\u662f\u5176\u9886\u571f\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u8feb\u4f7f\u56fd\u9645\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u505c\u6b62\u5c06\u8be5\u5c9b\u5217\u4e3a\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002 David Chang/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\n\u4eba\u6743\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u9996\u5e2d\u6218\u7565\u5b98\u4e9a\u5386\u514b\u65af\u00b7\u683c\u62c9\u5fb7\u65af\u5766(Alex Gladstein)\u5c06\u5965\u65af\u9646\u81ea\u7531\u8bba\u575b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u201c\u8fbe\u6c83\u65af\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u53cd\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6d3b\u52a8\u4eba\u58eb\u548c\u6297\u8bae\u8005\u7ad9\u4e0a\u8bb2\u53f0\uff0c\u6148\u5584\u5bb6\u548c\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4eba\u5750\u5728\u89c2\u4f17\u5e2d\u4e2d\u201d\u3002\n\n\n\n\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u53f0\u6e7e\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c11\u4e3b\u548c\u4eba\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5730\u533a\u9886\u8896\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u201c\u4e1c\u4e9a\u6ca1\u6709\u90a3\u4e48\u591a\u6210\u719f\u7684\u591a\u515a\u5236\u6c11\u4e3b\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\n\n\n\n\u683c\u62c9\u5fb7\u65af\u5766\u8bf4\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u662f\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u548c\u97e9\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u201c\u76ee\u524d\u4eba\u6743\u6d3b\u52a8\u4eba\u58eb\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5904\u5883\u6bd4\u5728\u97e9\u56fd\u53cb\u597d\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\u201c\u7531\u4e8e\u6587\u5728\u5bc5\u653f\u5e9c\u4e0e\u671d\u9c9c\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5916\u4ea4\u4e8b\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u89c6\u80dc\u4e8e\u4eba\u6743\u3002\u201d", "sentiment": 0.0, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u53f0\u6e7e\u5c06\u4e3e\u529e\u56fd\u9645\u4eba\u6743\u4f1a\u8bae"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/science/pygmies-flores-evolution.html", "text": "In 2003, researchers digging in a mountain cave on the Indonesian island of Flores discovered astonishing fossils of a tiny, humanlike individual with a small, chimp-sized brain.

Now, many institutions are increasing the money available; for example, Texas Christian University, whose incoming class last year was about one-fifth transfer students, the highest number in its history, now gives full-tuition scholarships for transfer students, something not available in the past, said Heath Einstein, the university\u2019s dean of admission.\n\nThe National Association for College Admission Counseling last year addressed another problem transfer students often face \u2014 being asked to make a deposit to guarantee their spot at their university before knowing how many of their credits will transfer or what financial aid they will receive. For the first time, the association published guidelines in its code of ethics specifying that colleges must provide transfer students with an evaluation of their credits and a good-faith estimate of how they will be applied to their degree, as well as a financial aid notification, before requiring a deposit.\n\nThe University of Central Florida, the second-largest university in the country, has more transfer students in its incoming class than first-year freshmen. Last fall, 62 percent of its incoming class consisted of transfer students.\n\nMany of those students \u2014 51 percent last year, or more than 6,000, \u2014 come through its highly lauded DirectConnect to U.C.F. program, which began in 2005, and partners with six community colleges, or state colleges as they\u2019re called in Florida.\n\nLast year, the university also created 27 \u201csuccess coaches\u201d who work with students planning to transfer and academic advisers to make sure the students have the skills and credits necessary before and after transferring.\n\n\u201cA freshman has four years to engage with our institution. A transfer student only has two years with us,\u201d said Jennifer Sumner, the executive director for U.C.F. Connect, which oversees the DirectConnect program. \u201cWe want to work with students so they feel a part of the university culture, and reduce the lag time to get them acclimated to the institution.\u201d\n\nA major sign of its success is that 71 percent of DirectConnect students graduate with a bachelor\u2019s within six years of starting their college careers, Dr. Sumner said. The nationwide college graduation rate is almost 60 percent for students who graduate within six years from the college where they started, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That compares to a graduation rate of 42 percent for transfer students within six years of starting at a community college, according to the National Student Clearinghouse. Since many transfer students lose credits when they switch schools and go part time, they often take longer to graduate.", "sentiment": 0.13861764705882354, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Colleges and Universities Woo Once-Overlooked Transfer Students"}, {"published": "2018-07-23T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/crosswords/who-made-my-puzzle-mary-lou-guizzo.html", "text": "Where do you currently reside?\n\nDayton, Ohio\n\nWhere and when was your first puzzle published?\n\nMy first published crossword puzzle was \u201cInflation,\u201d a collaboration with Jeff Chen.

I also started solving the daily Los Angeles Times puzzles and (at that time) weekly Wall Street Journal puzzles, as well as the puzzles in New York Magazine.\n\nWhat made you decide to try your hand at making a crossword puzzle?\n\nI enjoyed reading Jim Horne\u2019s blog about the New York Times puzzle [The genesis of Wordplay; here\u2019s his 2010 farewell. \u2014 D.A.], as well as Amy Reynaldo\u2019s \u201cDiary of a Crossword Fiend\u201d and Zhouqin Burnikel\u2019s \u201cL.A.

I have an ongoing vocabulary list. If I see or hear something I like, I just add it to the list, then update my Crossfire vocabulary as time permits.\n\nWhat entry or entries would you NEVER put in a puzzle, and why?

Where that information was drawn from is mostly undisclosed, the study found.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a continuum of data collectors, data sharers and data users within this large ecosystem,\u201d said N. Cameron Russell, the center\u2019s executive director, describing it as a \u201chuge invisible world\u201d of shifting business entities of which the public is mostly unaware. The companies offer school districts incentives to use \u201cfreemium\u201d services, free or discounted products for which, Mr. Russell says, \u201cyou\u2019re paying with your personal information.\u201d\n\nThe presence of trackers from data brokers such as BlueKai, AddThis or DataLogix on school sites should be viewed as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that demands an explanation, Mr. Polonetsky said, because those companies commonly engage in the buying, selling and linking of user data. Mr. Levin found all three on the websites of the Huntsville, Ala., schools on one recent day. He found AddThis on public school sites in Cleveland; Springfield, Mo.; Washington, D.C.; and Albuquerque.\n\nBlueKai was among the 22 trackers Mr. Levin found on the Pinellas County, Fla., schools site. Ms. Wolf said she did not know how it got there. \u201cIt is the district\u2019s expectation that our partners do not sell or misuse web visitor information,\u201d she said.\n\nSome limits exist on how far trackers can intrude.

President Trump recently proposed a $12 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the trade war he started, and senior White House advisers have called for a second round of tax cuts that would make permanent the individual rate cuts in the first tax law, at a cost of roughly $600 billion. Reports suggest the administration is mulling a unilateral change to the taxation of capital gains that would add another $100 billion to the deficit. Another giant spending bill is on the horizon.\n\nRepublican governance has shown how much the party actually cares about the deficit: not one bit.\n\nThe party\u2019s hypocrisy on the budget is not new. After Bill Clinton dramatically shrank both deficits and government spending as a share of the economy, George W. Bush took office and proceeded to dramatically increase both.\n\nYet the thoroughness of the Republicans\u2019 insincerity is still remarkable. Through their actions, they have proven that they cared about the deficit primarily for its usefulness as a political cudgel, an easy way to curtail Democratic policy goals.\n\nSo it is hardly surprising that Democrats, driven by young progressives, would respond by moving toward an agenda that no longer treats those concerns as genuine. True, even Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has not entirely given up the pretense of caring about deficits. In a recent \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d appearance, she was asked how she would pay for her agenda, and she responded by proposing a series of tax increases and a significant reduction in military spending.\n\nThe core tax changes would raise about $2 trillion over 10 years, she said, while additional, unspecified revenue could be raised through defense cuts and a carbon tax. Think tanks from across the political spectrum estimate a Bernie Sanders-style single-payer system would cost around $32 trillion over a decade, and while that might be less, overall, than the current partially private system, the challenge would be to finance the enormous increase in government spending on health care. Even making generous assumptions, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s additional revenue is still not enough to offset the cost. And that doesn\u2019t even include the rest of her platform.\n\nShe also made several errors about the details of the federal budget. And while it is not uncommon for elected officials to lack knowledge about the particulars of policy (Mr. Trump, who once declared that the real unemployment rate was 42 percent, is no one\u2019s idea of a wonk), both her errors and answers seemed to suggest that finding plausible ways to finance the full cost of her policies is not exactly at the top of her agenda. And if one of the Democrats\u2019 brightest young stars isn\u2019t overly concerned about basic budget math, it\u2019s hardly a stretch to imagine that much of the rest of the party will follow. Indeed, there is already a movement within liberal policy circles arguing that debt and deficits are far less important than most lawmakers have assumed.\n\nOne can perhaps imagine a Republican Party that could defend conventional notions of fiscal responsibility with some semblance of integrity, a conservative movement that governed according to its professed principles; even some deficit doves might find such a party useful as a pragmatic counterweight to progressive ambitions.\n\nBut although Republicans will surely attack the new class of Democratic Socialists and their policies as debt-increasing budget busters \u2014 that is, after all, what Republicans do \u2014 their own actions will ensure that those criticisms have no real authority. Their opposition to the socialist agenda will be hollow, because they helped make that agenda possible.\n\nPeter Suderman (@petersuderman) is the managing editor at Reason.com.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.", "sentiment": 0.11191200000000004, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Opinion | How Republican Hypocrisy Lifts Social Democrats"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/trumps-biggest-climate-move-yet-is-bad-for-everyone.html", "text": "Though the E.P.A. approved California\u2019s greenhouse gas standards in 2013, the agency now argues that they impermissibly conflict with another federal law, the Energy Policy Conservation Act. That law, passed in 1975 in response to the energy crisis, gives the Transportation Department the sole power to set standards \u201crelating to fuel economy.\u201d Because auto companies comply with California\u2019s greenhouse gas standards primarily by improving fuel efficiency, the E.P.A. now says in an about-face that the standards are pre-empted by those Transportation Department regulations. On the same theory, California\u2019s program to promote electric and hybrid vehicles would also be eliminated.\n\nIf the Trump administration succeeds in scuttling the federal standards and neutralizing California, it could be the most significant setback for American progress on climate change so far under President Trump. Worse, this disastrous policy could continue well beyond his tenure. Future presidents could not simply undo the decision, if courts rule that the Trump administration\u2019s interpretation of the law is categorically correct. In that case only Congress could restore California\u2019s authority.\n\nHere is what is at stake: The Obama-era standards that President Trump seeks to scrap would gradually raise average fuel economy under test conditions from about 37 miles per gallon in 2020 to 50 miles per gallon in 2025 \u2014 a near-doubling of fuel efficiency and halving of greenhouse gas emissions since 2010. This would reduce American oil consumption by 1.2 billion barrels, cut half a billion metric tons of carbon pollution and save consumers billions of dollars in fuel costs, according to the E.P. A\u2019s own recent estimates.\n\nFor over 50 years, California has been the undisputed leader among the states in addressing air pollution and its harms. In the 1950s and 1960s, the state had some of the dirtiest air in the world, in large part because of vehicular pollution. California required auto companies to install the first pollution control technology in 1961, and set the nation\u2019s first tailpipe standards for emissions in 1966. In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed legislation creating the powerful California Air Resources Board to regulate air pollution statewide, including by strictly curbing vehicle emissions.\n\nCongress recognized California\u2019s leadership when it passed the Air Quality Act of 1967, allowing the state to set its own stricter-than federal standards for vehicles. Congress cemented this approach in the 1970 Clean Air Act, and reinforced it again in 1977, letting other states adopt California\u2019s standards.", "sentiment": 0.10558333333333333, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Biggest Climate Move Yet is Bad for Everyone"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/uber-new-york-city-traffic-de-blasio.html", "text": "Are ride-sharing and -hailing services like Uber and Lyft causing road congestion? This has been the perception in cities across the country, and the companies have come under fire for it. In New York City, it has led to a proposal to curb, for a year, for-hire-vehicle companies from adding new driver's licenses (except for wheelchair-accessible vehicles).\n\nWill proposals to limit ride hailing succeed at reducing road congestion? In New York, the answer can be found in a report by the mayor\u2019s office. This $2 million study was conducted by McKinsey and other consultants to investigate whether ride-hailing companies have worsened traffic in the city.\n\nFrom 2009 (before ride hailing) through 2015, the study finds that reductions in vehicular speeds began long before ride hailing hit the stage, and the pattern did not change after ride hailing. The primary factors of reductions in vehicular speed, according to the study, are increased freight movement, construction activity and tourism, population and job growth.\n\nIn short, ride hailing is not responsible for greater road congestion.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2015, pedestrian growth in Manhattan\u2019s central business district grew by about 18 to 24 percent. This slows cars down; at turns, they have to wait for crossing pedestrians.

It\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019m going to come up with anything other than a direct explanation. [Durable sample from an ophthalmologist] hits all three needs: \u201cOphthalmologist\u201d indicates vision correction, \u201cdurable\u201d signals the HARD part, and \u201csample\u201d is singular, so it\u2019s just one LENS. Nothing to love here, but it does the job. It\u2019s generally good form, on a Tuesday especially, for the clue to hint at all the components of a compound entry.\n\nWILBER: Since this phrase tends to appear \u201cin the wild\u201d as HARD CONTACT LENS, you might use \u201ccontacts\u201d in the clue. [Less flexible choice in contacts], maybe. A solver might be able to pencil in LENS immediately off that, and maybe HARD as well. But my idea doesn\u2019t do as well at making eye care explicit, or at making single versus plural explicit \u2014 both important early in the week. Let\u2019s stick with your original.\n\n69 Across: SEAT\n\nWEINTRAUB: So many options with this word. Is \u201cseat\u201d a noun or a verb? Is it a chair? Someone\u2019s rear end? A government position? Something an usher does? Because there are so many different angles to take, you can have fun with it. Challenge yourself to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before. I\u2019m thinking about an airline seat. I like [Cabin assignment], which is fairly obvious if you immediately pick up that I\u2019m talking about an airplane, but trickier if you don\u2019t.\n\n2 Down: EVAN\n\nWEINTRAUB: Lots of Evans to choose from. I like musical theater, so I\u2019m going with [\u201cDear ___ Hansen\u201d]. It\u2019s a gimme if you\u2019re a Broadway fan, but probably a complete mystery if you\u2019re not. So an important thing to remember when you showcase trivia is making sure that none of the crossing words are problematic. It\u2019s not fair to the solver to have two obscure words (or clues for them) crossing. Here the crosses are all straightforward and I\u2019m comfortable choosing a less obvious clue for EVAN.\n\n10 Down: OLIVIA MUNN and 11 Down: DANA SCULLY\n\nWILBER: Time to address our first pair of long, nontheme entries: OLIVIA MUNN and DANA SCULLY. I know Ms. Munn from HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d \u2014 that series lasted a while, but is no longer current. \u201cDeliver Us From Evil\u201d might be just the ticket for some, who knows? Not my bag. I\u2019m penciling in [She plays Psylocke in the X-Men movie franchise]. Oh, except we have LOCK in the grid. \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d it is, then. Hmm \u2026 my best advice for cluing the Scully character, especially for a Tuesday, is not to do a deep dive for \u201cX Files\u201d trivia, like something the character did in a specific episode. How about [Skeptical F.B.I. agent in a paranormal Fox series]? Not too long, but content rich instead of vague.\n\n18 Down: OGRE\n\nWEINTRAUB: Normally I\u2019d go the \u201cShrek\u201d route on this, but this particular grid contains quite a few proper names, both real and fictional, so I\u2019m going to eschew adding any additional pop-culture references and go nonspecific: [Fairy tale antagonist].\n\n25 Down: ANTE UP\n\nWEINTRAUB: \u201cAnte up\u201d can be something one does, or it can be a request from someone to throw money in the pot. A quote clue provides more variety to your puzzle, so that\u2019s my preference. [\u201cTime to play the next hand \u2026\u201d].

They\u2019ve studied it to understand regeneration, photosymbiosis and climate change. But the plant-worm\u2019s collective behavior has only recently captivated scientists like Dr. Sendova-Franks.\n\nAt first glance, it looks and acts like a plant. But it has a rudimentary brain and nervous system, and if you chop off its head, it rejuvenates. It also has gravity sensors and eye-like photoreceptors. As a juvenile, the worm swallows solar-powered algae that lose their cell walls, eyes (yes, the algae have eyespots) and wiggly tails.\n\nThe algae gets incorporated into the worm\u2019s body, between its skin and muscles, and becomes the source of all the nutrients it needs to stay alive. Like corals that host their own algae, the worms bleach in acidic environments, expelling their algae and dying.\n\nAfter observing worms swirling in the lab, Dr. Sendova-Franks and her colleagues at the University of Bristol ventured to the northern shores of Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, to see if this circular milling occurs in nature.", "sentiment": 0.06593076923076921, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "That\u2019s Not Algae Swirling on the Beach.

The main part of the scene was shot in a club space, and to film the faces an additional camera was set up in a changing room on the side. Shooting the two aspects of the scene at the same time proved to be a challenge because the same extras appeared in both the wide shots of the crowd and the portraits. \u201cThe continuity is crazy in that scene because we were snatching people out of seats to shoot them in the other room,\u201d Mr. Lee said.\n\nFloating Down the Street", "sentiment": 0.0574857142857143, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "How Spike Lee Created Three Signature Visual Shots"}, {"published": "2018-07-20T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-07-21.html", "text": "SATURDAY PUZZLE \u2014 We haven\u2019t seen a puzzle from Jason Flinn in over a year, so I looked him up on xwordinfo.com to refresh my knowledge.

President Trump recently proposed a $12 billion bailout for farmers hurt by the trade war he started, and senior White House advisers have called for a second round of tax cuts that would make permanent the individual rate cuts in the first tax law, at a cost of roughly $600 billion. Reports suggest the administration is mulling a unilateral change to the taxation of capital gains that would add another $100 billion to the deficit. Another giant spending bill is on the horizon.\n\nRepublican governance has shown how much the party actually cares about the deficit: not one bit.\n\nThe party\u2019s hypocrisy on the budget is not new. After Bill Clinton dramatically shrank both deficits and government spending as a share of the economy, George W. Bush took office and proceeded to dramatically increase both.\n\nYet the thoroughness of the Republicans\u2019 insincerity is still remarkable. Through their actions, they have proven that they cared about the deficit primarily for its usefulness as a political cudgel, an easy way to curtail Democratic policy goals.\n\nSo it is hardly surprising that Democrats, driven by young progressives, would respond by moving toward an agenda that no longer treats those concerns as genuine. True, even Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has not entirely given up the pretense of caring about deficits. In a recent \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d appearance, she was asked how she would pay for her agenda, and she responded by proposing a series of tax increases and a significant reduction in military spending.\n\nThe core tax changes would raise about $2 trillion over 10 years, she said, while additional, unspecified revenue could be raised through defense cuts and a carbon tax. Think tanks from across the political spectrum estimate a Bernie Sanders-style single-payer system would cost around $32 trillion over a decade, and while that might be less, overall, than the current partially private system, the challenge would be to finance the enormous increase in government spending on health care. Even making generous assumptions, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s additional revenue is still not enough to offset the cost. And that doesn\u2019t even include the rest of her platform.\n\nShe also made several errors about the details of the federal budget. And while it is not uncommon for elected officials to lack knowledge about the particulars of policy (Mr. Trump, who once declared that the real unemployment rate was 42 percent, is no one\u2019s idea of a wonk), both her errors and answers seemed to suggest that finding plausible ways to finance the full cost of her policies is not exactly at the top of her agenda. And if one of the Democrats\u2019 brightest young stars isn\u2019t overly concerned about basic budget math, it\u2019s hardly a stretch to imagine that much of the rest of the party will follow. Indeed, there is already a movement within liberal policy circles arguing that debt and deficits are far less important than most lawmakers have assumed.\n\nOne can perhaps imagine a Republican Party that could defend conventional notions of fiscal responsibility with some semblance of integrity, a conservative movement that governed according to its professed principles; even some deficit doves might find such a party useful as a pragmatic counterweight to progressive ambitions.\n\nBut although Republicans will surely attack the new class of Democratic Socialists and their policies as debt-increasing budget busters \u2014 that is, after all, what Republicans do \u2014 their own actions will ensure that those criticisms have no real authority. Their opposition to the socialist agenda will be hollow, because they helped make that agenda possible.\n\nPeter Suderman (@petersuderman) is the managing editor at Reason.com.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.", "sentiment": 0.11191200000000004, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Opinion | How Republican Hypocrisy Lifts Social Democrats"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/health/fda-fentanyl-opioid-epidemic-overdose-cancer.html", "text": "The fentanyl in her blood was between 15 and 20 times the appropriate level, according to a toxicology report.\n\nThe F.D.A. documents obtained by researchers included a survey by the industry group in 2013 in which nearly 40 percent of T.I.R.F. prescribers said they had used the drug to treat chronic pain in patients who did not have cancer, like Ms. Fuller.\n\nIn the survey, 42 percent of pharmacists stated that the drugs were appropriate for those ailments.\n\nIn another survey three years later, in February 2017, almost one in five T.I.R.F. prescribers (18 percent) and almost one in two patients (48 percent) said they believed, wrongly, that the medications were formally approved by the F.D.A. to treat illnesses other than cancer.\n\nJust over half of patients prescribed the drugs were not already taking a round-the-clock opioid regimen, and therefore were susceptible to an accidental overdose, according to an analysis of commercial health plan claims for more than 25,000 patients by the industry group in 2016.

I was interested in aversion, not identification and certainly not celebration. Maybe that\u2019s because when I was growing up, gayness, for me at least, was fundamentally mixed up with AIDS. I wasn\u2019t, certainly not in my teens, really able to extricate my sense of homosexuality from the specter of the epidemic. It loomed large even while I was watching \u201cBoys,\u201d which was written more than a decade before the first diagnoses: Right at the beginning, when an offstage character is described as having canceled an appointment because of \u201ca virus or something,\u201d I heard these chords of doom.\n\nSCHNEIER It was almost a shock to see a play that predates the AIDS epidemic, that didn\u2019t have to grapple with it. (When characters tease one another about lingering in bathhouses, I thought, \u201cUh oh, I know where this is going.\u201d) I wonder if in some ways the need to respond to the AIDS crisis helped to mobilize and alchemize some of the loathing that \u201cBoys\u201d reveals and, in a weird way, revels in, toward more productive ends. You may not be able to eradicate it entirely, but you can turn its firepower toward more deserving targets: A terrible disease and a Reagan-era world murderously slow on the uptake.\n\nWESLEY MORRIS The completist part of me was curious to see \u201cBoys in the Band\u201d in the context of the gay cultural artifacts that have come back. We\u2019re currently drowning in the return of the return of the gay past: this show; a mostly galvanic \u201cAngels in America\u201d; last year\u2019s electric \u201cFalsettos\u201d revival; \u201cPose\u201d on FX, which is set in the ball scene of the late 1980s; \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d; the return of \u201cBuddies,\u201d Arthur J. Bressan Jr.\u2019s talky, mostly forgotten AIDS friendship dramedy from 1985; and whatever this revivified \u201cWill & Grace\u201d is supposed to be. There\u2019s also the aggravating nostalgia of \u201cLove, Simon,\u201d a limp romantic-comedy only nominally set in the 21st century.\n\nThese are very different works, but lumped together, I do wonder whether we\u2019re interrogating the past or luxuriating in it, hiding from the present or reframing it. Zachary Quinto\u2019s daring decision to play the part of Harold in \u201cBoys\u201d as Nosferatu makes sense. He\u2019s the birthday boy. He\u2019s also powerfully undead.\n\nWOOLFE I think Matthew\u2019s right in saying the play revels in self-loathing. The extravagance and explicitness of the self-hatred on display bring it ever closer to self-love. In a way, the play is a utopian fantasy of a wholly gay little world (with the insertion of one terrified, maybe-probably-closeted straight man as the exception that proves the rule) at the final moment before that world was \u2014 finally, necessarily, violently \u2014 merged with the mainstream. I wasn\u2019t left feeling like it was all that bitter; in a lot of ways, and perhaps this is looking back on the pre-AIDS era, it felt wishful and kind of sweet. And poignant: You can\u2019t help but consider which of these characters will be dead in 20 years.\n\nSCHNEIER I disagree here. I think the characters love their own eloquence \u2014 they cast their sparring explicitly as a battle of wits \u2014 but I think the toxicity of it is very real, and I felt for them while wanting to get out of their purgatorial apartment as fast as I could. The play does offer the consolation that these wounded souls have each other, and they pair off in ways \u2014 romantic, platonic \u2014 that I think we\u2019re meant to understand sustain them. Even viperous best friends Michael and Harold: \u201cCall you tomorrow,\u201d Harold says as he exits, and we know he will. But it feels like a punishment as much as a balm.

Look closer at most wellness sites and at many of their physician partners, and you\u2019ll find a plethora of medical conspiracy theories: Vaccines and autism. The dangers of water fluoridation. Bras and breast cancer. Cellphones and brain cancer. Heavy metal poisoning. AIDS as a construct of Big Pharma.\n\nMost people think they will be immune to these fringe ideas, but science says otherwise. We all mistake repetition for accuracy, a phenomenon called the illusory truth effect, and knowledge about the subject matter doesn\u2019t necessarily protect you. Even a single exposure to information that sounds like it could be quasi-plausible can increase the perception of accuracy.\n\nBelief in medical conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the pharmaceutical industry is suppressing \u201cnatural\u201d cures, increases the likelihood that a person will take dietary supplements. So to keep selling supplements and earthing mats and coffee enema kits and the other revenue generating merchandise, you can\u2019t just spark fear. You must constantly stoke its flames.\n\nThere can be no modern wellness industry without medical conspiracy theories.\n\nEven if you completely eschew these sites for the chicanery they are, people who come to believe this misinformation can affect public health by both their failure to vaccinate and by voting against evidence-based health policies.\n\nAlso, as a doctor I take it to heart when I hear about the latest measles outbreak or when a friend spends money on a therapy that can\u2019t possibly help. When patients ask for an unsupported t est \u2014 such as urine chelation or salivary hormone levels, often promoted on wellness sites \u2014 I have to explain that I can\u2019t in good faith order a useless test.\n\nI also don\u2019t want people to die.\n\nSo why do people turn to wellness?\n\nThere are symptoms that I believe have been with us since the beginning of time, so common that they are likely part of the human experience: fatigue, bloat, low libido, episodic pain, loss of vigor. When medicine can only offer a therapy, not a cure, or when doctors give undesired answers \u2014 suggesting attention to sleep hygiene, for instance \u2014 it isn\u2019t hard to see how the intoxicating confidence and theater of wellness could beckon.", "sentiment": -0.08489999999999999, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Worshiping the False Idols of Wellness"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/auto-emissions-california-cafe.html", "text": "The Trump administration\u2019s decision to try to weaken President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark 2012 agreement to increase fuel efficiency and decrease global warming emissions from automobiles is dismaying on so many levels that it is hard to know where to begin.\n\nThe proposal from the current administration would freeze the average fuel economy after 2021 at about 37 miles per gallon; the Obama-era rule would have required automakers to hit an average of about 54 miles per gallon by 2025. The Trump plan would also revoke a waiver that the federal government granted to California, which allows the state to set stricter standards because of its particular air pollution problems.\n\nCars and trucks are currently the largest source of planet-warming emissions in the United States.\n\nThe proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation sets up a protracted legal fight with California and the 13 other states, including New York and New Jersey, that have chosen to follow its stronger standards. The state\u2019s waiver was authorized under the 1970 Clean Air Act and has been renewed dozens of times by the E.P.A.

His lawyers have told him he has no personal legal exposure and that the only threat to him would be impeachment proceedings if the Democrats win control of the House in November.\n\nMr. Mueller remains interested in key areas Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers worry will prove problematic for him, particularly whether he obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director. Mr. Comey has testified the president pressured him to drop an investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.\n\nLegal experts and law enforcement officials who have worked with Mr. Mueller have said that they believe he would pursue all available avenues to get Mr. Trump to answer questions about his conduct and try to determine his intent. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, however, remain unconvinced that Mr. Mueller would risk losing a subpoena fight in court.\n\nFor the past week, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration about the confluences of investigations that have dogged him. The president told his advisers that the Russia inquiry and a separate federal investigation in Manhattan into his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, have undermined him for too long and need to be brought to an end.\n\nThe president\u2019s concerns were reignited by both the start of the money fraud trial of his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and the release last week of a recording on which he and Mr. Cohen are heard discussing hush money payments during the campaign to a former Playboy model who says she had an affair with Mr. Trump. He denies the affair.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, those frustrations burst into public view. Mr. Trump fired off a string of tweets, including a call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.

These wines were fresh and refreshing and would be wonderful on a summer\u2019s evening with Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food. Our favorites were often profoundly herbal and floral.\n\nIn a way, I thought, they were a little reminiscent aromatically of a mild version of retsina, the historic Greek white that is flavored with pine sap. I say this with some trepidation as retsina is generally as reviled as it is misunderstood, but I mean it as a compliment. Don\u2019t worry; none of these actually tasted like retsina.\n\nOur favorite was the 2017 Hoof & Lur from Troupis made from moschofilero grapes grown in Mantinia. Moschofilero, like roditis, is a pink-hued white grape, and it can sometimes make wines like this one that might appear to be ros\u00e9s. Regardless of the tinge, this was a lively, balanced, deliciously herbal wine with citrus flavors.\n\nAn unusual wine, our second pick, is made from the ancient muscat of Alexandria grape, which is found all over the Mediterranean. Often, it\u2019s used to make sweet wines, although I\u2019ve had excellent dry examples from Sicily, where it\u2019s called zibibbo. This bottle, the 2017 Terra Ambera from Manolis Garalis on Lemnos, a volcanic island in the Aegean, was dry, perfumed and floral.\n\nOur third wine was the 2016 Theon Dora from Giannis Stilianou in Crete, crisp, fresh and minty. It was a particular study in obscurity, as it was made from three grapes that were unknown to me: vidiano, thrapsathiri and vilana, all indigenous to Crete.\n\nThe 2017 Notios from Gai\u2019a in Nemea, an area better known for producing red wines, was our fourth choice. This bottle, made of moschofilero and roditis, leaned toward a more familiar Mediterranean style, but it was very well-done.\n\nThe next two wines were both made of malagousia, a grape that was on the verge of disappearing in Greece 30 years ago but has been resurrected and is now found all over the country. The first, rendered malagouzia, is the 2017 from Antonopoulos in the Achaia region in the northern Peloponnese: tangy, fresh and slightly more austere than the zesty, harmonious 2016 malagousia from

something went haywire in Dennis\u2019s head long before Henry Deaver returned to Castle Rock. Earlier, in Episode 2, he seemed to lose his faculties a bit on the job, hallucinating the deaths he would later cause. There\u2019s no indication when he snaps and starts executing his co-workers that he has actually been possessed by whatever evil spirits Warden Lacy was trying to keep at bay. Instead, the explanation for Dennis\u2019s shooting appears more plain. He\u2019d hoped that Henry, in taking on the case of the mysterious \u201cKid,\u201d would eventually expose the corruption at Shawshank. When Henry suddenly decides that he needs to leave town instead, Dennis takes matters into his own hands.\n\nWhat drives Henry to wrap up his business so soon? Again, there\u2019s no apparent juju at work. At the start of the episode, Henry seems committed to staying the course in Castle Rock. He has turned down a settlement deal for the Kid (involving immediate release, a fair bit of cash and no admission of wrongdoing from Shawshank\u2019s corporate overlords) because, he says, \u201cYou take their money, you gotta take their version of the story.\u201d He has also taken steps to settle some old family business, beginning with his adoptive father\u2019s remains, which he wants to move from a nondescript lot in Augusta.\n\nBut ever since he returned home, Henry has been reminded daily of the hellish experience he went through in the woods when he was 11. He has also become acutely aware that pretty much everyone in town thinks he killed his dad during his disappearance. By the end of this episode, he has decided that he can\u2019t take the psychological pressure.\n\nOrdinarily, I\u2019m not a huge fan of teasing audiences with clues to some eventual revelation about an unimaginable tragedy. Right now, \u201cCastle Rock\u201d is working that angle on multiple fronts. We don\u2019t know what happened to Henry. We don\u2019t know what happened to his dad. We don\u2019t really know who the Kid is, or why he has been secretly stashed in Shawshank for so long. My problem with this approach is that, more often than not, the payoff isn\u2019t worth the delay.\n\nBut when the scenes are as well-crafted and executed as those in \u201cCastle Rock,\u201d that frustration is at least somewhat mitigated. One of this week\u2019s best sequences, for example, works in large part because of its disorienting low-angle shots and Andr\u00e9 Holland\u2019s unnerved facial expressions, not merely because of what we don\u2019t know.

It was a dull, blue, helpful, we-keep-the-lights-on-ma\u2019am concept that was, thinking back on it, quite telling.\n\nThat\u2019s because it was based in the idea that Facebook was essentially benign. Worse: Mr. Zuckerberg stuck with this mix of extreme earnestness and willful na\u00efvet\u00e9 for far too long.\n\nBecause what he never managed to grok then was that the company he created was destined to become a template for all of humanity, the digital reflection of masses of people across the globe. Including \u2014 and especially \u2014 the bad ones.\n\nWas it because he was a computer major who left college early and did not attend enough humanities courses that might have alerted him to the uglier aspects of human nature? Maybe. Or was it because he has since been steeped in the relentless positivity of Silicon Valley, where it is verboten to imagine a bad outcome? Likely. Could it be that while the goal was to \u201cconnect people,\u201d he never anticipated that the platform also had to be responsible for those people when they misbehaved? Oh, yes. And, finally, was it that the all-numbers-go-up-and-to-the-right mentality of Facebook blinded him to the shortcuts that get taken in the service of growth? Most definitely.\n\nThese issues were all still on full display in a podcast interview I did with Mr. Zuckerberg a few weeks ago. You\u2019d have imagined that all this time, and all the money and power he has collected, would have wizened him.\n\nNot so much.

It was his opinion that Caesar\u2019s public rejection of a kingly crown was actually a way to manipulate Romans into making him king:\n\n\u201cI can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery. I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet \u2019twas not a crown neither, \u2019twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once \u2014 but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again \u2014 but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. \u201d\n\nWhile he wasn\u2019t fooled by Caesar\u2019s humility, CASCA was one of the last to join the conspiracy to kill Caesar. CASCA\u2019s family had been loyal to Caesar. And in Shakespeare\u2019s play, at least, CASCA was more of a follower than a leader, in that he was willing to do what was necessary, but only if someone else had gone there first:\n\n\u201cI will set this foot of mine as far\n\nAs who goes farthest.\u201d\n\nOnce CASCA was on board with the assassination, the conspirators (including Publius CASCA\u2019s brother, Gaius CASCA) met Caesar at the Theater of Pompey, and stopped him in a hallway. A co-conspirator, Tillius Cimber, distracted Caesar with a petition to recall his exiled brother, and pulled at Caesar\u2019s toga as a signal to strike. CASCA\u2019s words, in Shakespeare\u2019s play, were \u201cSpeak, hands for me!\u201d and he stabbed Caesar superficially in the neck, just missing his collarbone.\n\n\n\nTerrified, CASCA cried out to his brother for help, and Gaius CASCA ran Caesar through with his sword. It is said that Caesar eventually was stabbed 23 times by the group of conspirators.\n\nInterestingly, Publius CASCA subsequently fought on the side of the liberators in the Liberators\u2019 War, led by Mark Antony, to avenge the death of Caesar. He is believed to have killed himself after their defeat at the Battle of Philippi in 42 B.C.", "sentiment": -0.2442526315789474, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "What the Heck Is That?"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/world/asia/afghanistan-kabul-kidnapping.html", "text": "KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Three foreign catering workers were found shot dead outside the Afghan capital on Thursday after being kidnapped during their morning commute, the Afghan police said.\n\nIt was the latest in a yearslong series of such attacks, this time against employees of Sodexo, a global food services company that works for several international organizations in Kabul.

Done correctly, the diagonal of that square spelled the answer to the riddle: TEETH. That was genius.\n\nMel was a frequent official in the early days of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, where his quick wit was always evident. To retell an old story, Evie Eysenburg, another official at the tournament, proposed the \u201cHenry Hook and Mel Rosen Diet\u201d: By sitting between these two hilarious people at dinner, she was always laughing so hard that she never had time to swallow her food.", "sentiment": 0.079875, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Mel Rosen (1941 \u2014 2018)"}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "http://cn.nytimes.com/china/20180801/xi-jinping-internal-dissent/", "text": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\u60c5\u7eea\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bf9\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u624b\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u529b\u6784\u6210\u4efb\u4f55\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u548c\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u4ecd\u7262\u7262\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u652f\u6301\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u7684\u53cd\u8150\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u4ed6\u628a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5efa\u8bbe\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5728\u9886\u571f\u4e89\u7aef\u4e0a\u59a5\u534f\u7684\u5f3a\u56fd\u7684\u8a93\u8a00\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u515a\u5185\u4eba\u58eb\u548c\u5916\u56fd\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bf4\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u8d77\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u601d\u60f3\u5f00\u660e\u7684\u524d\u5b98\u5458\u548c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u5c42\u4e2d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6b63\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u5f3a\u786c\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u4e00\u4f4d\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u5177\u540d\u7684\u524d\u5b98\u5458\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u90fd\u5728\u4f20\u9605\u8bb8\u7ae0\u6da6\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002\n\n\u5305\u62ec\u6b64\u4eba\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6279\u8bc4\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6c47\u96c6\u6210\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4fb5\u8680\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u7684\u6743\u5a01\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b98\u5458\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u52c7\u6c14\u6765\u8d28\u7591\u4ed6\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e0e\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u6218\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u3002\u4e94\u6708\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u6c5f\u82cf\u7701\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e2f\u53e3\u7b49\u5f85\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u94a2\u94c1\u3002 China Daily Cdic/Reuters\n\n\u201c\u66f4\u96be\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u6765\u8bf4\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u201d\u9a6c\u5229\u5fb7\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\u8bb0\u8005\u63d0\u95ee\u65f6\u8bf4\u3002\u201c\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6743\u8d35\u653f\u6cbb\u5185\u6597\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u653f\u7b56\u762b\u75ea\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u573a\u66f4\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002\u201d", "sentiment": 0.0, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u906d\u7f55\u89c1\u6279\u8bc4\uff1a\u5b66\u8005\u547c\u5401\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u671f\u9650\u5236\u3001\u5e73\u53cd\u516d\u56db"}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/style/eckhaus-latta-whitney.html", "text": "All together, this kit and caboodle is really something else entirely, a kind of conceptual art installation that aims to encapsulate today\u2019s fashion system (if not today\u2019s galloping consumption of all kinds) through a distillation of our experience with shopping and clothes into a three-chambered feast for the eyes.

so I can explain it to you. You might not need it explained, but it\u2019s part of my job and I consider it an important responsibility.\n\nI\u2019m pretty good at recognizing themes, so when I needed help on a Monday puzzle, I was really surprised. It turns out that understanding today\u2019s theme by Gary Cee all depends on how you pronounce things.\n\nTricky Clues\n\n32A: This is true: The sun or a planet are ORBs. Unless you are a member of the Flat Earth Society.\n\n2D: Hi, kids! Other than Jade, the Extremely Spunky Border terrier, ASTA is the official dog of The New York Times Crossword (he\u2019s been in the crossword a total of 521 times since 1944). \u201cThe Thin Man\u201d was a 1934 detective novel by Dashiell Hammett, which was turned into a six part film series starring movie idols William Powell and Myrna Loy. But there was a third member of their detective team named ASTA, the elegant canine sidekick of the elegant 1930s rich couple, Nick and Nora Charles. Offstage, the dog\u2019s name was Skippy, but the wire-haired terrier stole hearts and scenes for his ability to sniff out dead bodies or hidden weapons.\n\n29D: Thought experiment: I wonder if there is an equivalent name for older men who pursue younger women. Or even one for older women who pursue younger women, which is a lot less heteronormative. Even so, the entry COUGARS is making an appearance in The New York Times Crossword for the first time since 1974, where it had previously been clued as either a football team or a mountain lion.",

town. Taking walks was (and still is) his odd signature thing; every tech founder has one. (Jeff Bezos: doors for desks and that laugh; Sergey Brin: yoga pants and weird shoes; Elon Musk: so, so many, and all quite inventive.)\n\nOn that forced stroll, there was one word that he kept coming back to: Facebook was a \u201cutility.\u201d\n\nIt was a curious metaphor to choose, because it was not the effortlessly hip image of his rival back then, Myspace, nor the multicolored everlasting Willy Wonka party that was going on over at Google. It was a dull, blue, helpful, we-keep-the-lights-on-ma\u2019am concept that was, thinking back on it, quite telling.\n\nThat\u2019s because it was based in the idea that Facebook was essentially benign. Worse: Mr. Zuckerberg stuck with this mix of extreme earnestness and willful na\u00efvet\u00e9 for far too long.\n\nBecause what he never managed to grok then was that the company he created was destined to become a template for all of humanity, the digital reflection of masses of people across the globe. Including \u2014 and especially \u2014 the bad ones.\n\nWas it because he was a computer major who left college early and did not attend enough humanities courses that might have alerted him to the uglier aspects of human nature? Maybe. Or was it because he has since been steeped in the relentless positivity of Silicon Valley, where it is verboten to imagine a bad outcome? Likely. Could it be that while the goal was to \u201cconnect people,\u201d he never anticipated that the platform also had to be responsible for those people when they misbehaved? Oh, yes. And, finally, was it that the all-numbers-go-up-and-to-the-right mentality of Facebook blinded him to the shortcuts that get taken in the service of growth? Most definitely.\n\nThese issues were all still on full display in a podcast interview I did with Mr. Zuckerberg a few weeks ago. You\u2019d have imagined that all this time, and all the money and power he has collected, would have wizened him.\n\nNot so much. Unfortunately, the conversation soon turned into a late-night freshman-year dorm-room debate, as he stumbled into a controversy of his own making by using Holocaust deniers and their appalling falsehoods as an example of how much dreck should be allowed on the platform.", "sentiment": -0.013800000000000008, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Opinion | The Expensive Education of Mark

the sound of booing from the biggest Yankee Stadium crowd of the season, having just allowed seven earned runs in less than three innings to the worst team in baseball. And yet, as he walked off the mound, he was flashing a toothy grin.\n\nGray had pitched well in his previous three starts, offering hope that he was returning to the form he had showed in the first three years of his career with the Oakland Athletics. But on Wednesday Gray turned in his worst outing of the season at a very poor time, with the Yankees about to embark on a four-game series on the road against the Boston Red Sox, the team they trail by five and a half games in the American League East.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was just frustrated,\u201d Gray (8-8, 5.56 E.R.A.) said of his smiling after the Yankees 7-5 loss to the Orioles. \u201cI think that everyone handles frustrations differently. I\u2019ve never been a guy who, when things aren\u2019t going his way and you get hit around, to come off the field and throw a glove or throw a hat or punch something. I\u2019ve always been a mellow guy who tries to think things through and get over it and move on. That\u2019s the way I\u2019ve handled things my whole life. Whether that\u2019s good or bad, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nClearly, the Yankee Stadium crowd of 47,206, swelled by an additional 2,000 fans admitted via standing-room admission introduced for August, thought it was bad. And for the first time this season, Manager Aaron Boone entertained the thought of removing Gray from the starting rotation \u2014 an option made more attractive by the performance of the newly acquired Lance Lynn, who pitched four and one-third scoreless innings in relief of Gray.", "sentiment": -0.003674999999999993, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Against Lowly Orioles, Sonny Gray Drags the Yankees Even Lower"}], "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/"}, "theguardian": {"articles": [{"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-labour-antisemitism-peter-willsman-momentum", "text": "Jeremy Corbyn is not known to sit in silence: to confront the controversial has been part of his mission since the day he entered the political fray. It was by giving voice and action to his convictions that he has remained so often on the right side of history; it was his decades of campaigning that provided the framework for Labour\u2019s progressive platform today. It\u2019s his resolve that inspired me and hundreds of thousands of others to join a movement, but I fear that today it\u2019s being hidden away.\n\nOn antisemitism, Labour needs strong and decisive leadership. Not because it\u2019s rampant in the party, but because it has become a distraction that is refusing to go away. The realty is that there are a smattering of Labour members among the half a million who are explicitly antisemitic, and a small yet vocal minority who are blind to the prejudice that is very much there.\n\nAntisemitism row: Momentum drops Peter Willsman from NEC re-election list Read more\n\nCommitted, socialist, Jewish Labour members have attempted to navigate the complexities of the situation: we have had to face some in our own religious community who have objected to our support for Labour; we have opposed those using the situation to try to harm Corbyn\u2019s leadership. We have also tried hard to educate those who have not understood the more subtle strains of antisemitism, such as the Rothschilds conspiracies and the Jewish-controlled media: being progressive means accepting there is a journey of education we all undertake.\n\nThere comes a point, however, where people can no longer be given the benefit of the doubt. Those who continue to peddle antisemitism are already being booted out of the party \u2013 but that process must be faster. Those who refuse to see it, such as Peter Willsman, must accept they are wrong if they are to remain.\n\nThe basis for this blindness is obvious \u2013 a siege mentality that has overtaken elements of Labour. It\u2019s not hard to understand why some Corbyn supporters feel afraid to concede there is a problem: it is a movement that is perpetually under attack. From the Czech spy drivel earlier this year to whether Corbyn bowed properly at the Cenotaph, there are those within Labour\u2019s ranks and outside of it who have made it their mission to destabilise his leadership at all costs. And many members feel that they are being tarnished as antisemites when it\u2019s simply not the case.\n\nBut it is time to come out of the bunker and hold our hands up \u2013 there is, however limited, a problem, and it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn himself who has to make this clear.\n\nThere are short-term actions that can and must be taken: Corbyn must distance himself from the insensitive comments made by Willsman, however painful it might at first seem. However well-meaning, the attempt by Labour to adapt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism into a more practical document has to be halted. That\u2019s despite the fact many Jewish members, myself included, believe it needs to be addressed. We must recognise that as it stands the trust between British Jewry and the Labour party just isn\u2019t there.\n\nPlay Video 0:52 Peter Willsman dismisses Labour antisemitism claims - audio\n\nThe most urgent, however, is for Corbyn to break his silence, and speak directly to the group of his supporters who are dismissing all incidents of antisemitism in Labour as lies in his name.\n\nCorbyn has vocally condemned antisemitism before, and made it clear that Labour will not tolerate it. But what is required now is a more reflective, self-critical analysis. Just because antisemitic sentiments may be expressed at lower levels in Labour than in other political parties, it doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t a problem that should be addressed. Just because the rampant Islamophobia plaguing the Conservative party gets far less airtime than it warrants doesn\u2019t mean antisemitism in Labour doesn\u2019t exist. Corbyn needs to explain that while Labour is no hotbed for antisemitism \u2013 far from it \u2013 admitting that it does exist, and taking that seriously, is no concession to those who so desperately wish to do him harm. It would only strengthen him.\n\nCorbyn allies split over Momentum's decision to drop Willsman Read more\n\nCorbyn needs to say firmly that responding to antisemitism with conspiracies, a rant about Israel, or anything other than a commitment to fighting it is unacceptable. If you do so Labour is no longer a place for you, and you are not his friend.\n\nJohn McDonnell is already showing the necessary contrition, visibly pained by the situation. Momentum has taken bold action and withdrawn its support from Willsman (the backlash from those who see that as capitulation is already under way). But Jon Lansman understands this is vital, however uncomfortable. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s painful, we have to take action on this and lead by example,\u201d he tells me. \u201cLabour is an antiracist party, but the perception among the Jewish community is that we are not taking antisemitism seriously and there is a distressing lack of trust.\u201d\n\nI understand why Corbyn has waited quietly \u2013 there are no doubt those around him who believe he should remain locked in the bunker to weather the storm. Today, though, I\u2019m appealing directly to my party\u2019s leader \u2013 without whom this problem won\u2019t go away. To risk alienating some of those who have long stood by him \u2013 advisers and supporters \u2013 won\u2019t be easy. It may feel disloyal, or as if he is throwing those who have shown loyalty under the bus. But the best chance we have of quelling this is for Corbyn himself to guide his supporters. He can\u2019t be accused of being a traitor to himself.\n\n\u2022 Michael Segalov is the news editor at Huck magazine and a freelance journalist", "sentiment": -0.06858, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Corbyn must step up and disown those who tolerate antisemitism | Michael Segalov"}, {"published": "2017-06-21T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2017/jun/21/bangalore-thirst-city-lakes-clean-water", "text": "Once known as the City of Lakes, urban sprawl has destroyed 85% of Bangalore\u2019s fresh water and pollution has ruined much of the rest.

And yet there is something about this soot-stained spot in the Ruhr valley that seems to encourage a particularly clear-sighted view of the rest of the world.\n\nWe could become China\u2019s gateway to Europe \u2013 and vice versa Mayor S\u00f6ren Link\n\nIn 1585, it was in Duisburg that Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator published a book of maps of European countries \u2013 the first ever \u201catlas\u201d to carry that name. And it was here that Mercator first presented his new world map, the \u201cMercator projection\u201d, that was so revolutionary for maritime navigators keen to steer merchant vessels across the high seas in the straightest possible line.\n\nIf in 2018 Duisburg is slowly rediscovering its cosmopolitan past, it is not just because four centuries after Mercator, traders are still trying to find the most direct route from A to B. As the threat of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and Brexit-related trade barriers is driving wedges between the EU and the Anglosphere, this former rust-belt town town allows one to see in real time how Germany and China are intensifying their economic ties.\n\n\n\nQ&A Cities of the New Silk Road: what is China's Belt and Road project? Show Hide China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China \u2013 and Chinese goods \u2013 with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century \"silk road\", made up of a \"belt\" of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime \"road\" of shipping lanes. Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects? In Cities of the New Silk Road we have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project's tangible results so far \u2013 from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed \u201cGermany\u2019s China city\u201d. Our correspondents have reported from the \u201cnext Dubai\u201d rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa\u2019s largest port, and more.\n\nNick Van Mead Read more: Cities of the New Silk Road\n\n\n\nEvery week, around 30 Chinese trains arrive at a vast terminal in Duisburg\u2019s inland port, their containers either stuffed with clothes, toys and hi-tech electronics from Chongqing, Wuhan or Yiwu, or carrying German cars, Scottish whisky, French wine and textiles from Milan heading the other way.\n\nIn Duisburg\u2019s port, where train tracks run straight to the edge of the Rhine River, goods are loaded straight on to ships, stored for further dispatch in one of several football pitch-sized storage units, or sent on by train or truck to Greece, Spain or Britain.\n\nThe Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world\n\nDuisburg was already regarded as the world\u2019s largest inland port. But thanks to the Belt and Road infrastructure project \u2013 a revival of the Silk Road route that Mercator had read about in the travelogues of Marco Polo, this time subsidised with billions of dollars by the Chinese government \u2013 the port is fast becoming Europe\u2019s central logistics hub. Around 80% of trains from China now make it their first European stop, with most using the northern silk road route via Khorgos on the China-Kazakhstan border and the Russian capital, Moscow.\n\nHow Duisburg connects to the Belt and Road How Duisburg connects to China\u2019s Belt (red) and Road (blue) routes.\n\nLocal politicians, while still proud of the city\u2019s links to the 16th-century mapmaker, also like to compliment the perceptive eye of modern Chinese cartographers: in a map of Europe displayed at Shanghai airport, they point out, Duisburg\u2019s name is printed larger than London, Paris or Berlin.\n\n\u201cWe are Germany\u2019s China city,\u201d says S\u00f6ren Link, Duisburg\u2019s Social Democrat mayor. For years, his city has been a symbol of the challenges of long-term structural changes facing industry in the Ruhr region: in 1987, photographs of thousands of Krupp steelworkers barricading a bridge over the Rhine protesting against imminent factory closures travelled around the world.\n\nIn 2018, Duisburg\u2019s unemployment rate of 12% is still almost four times as high as the German average, but at least the viral images are different: four years ago the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made Duisburg one of the few stops on his state visit to Germany and was welcomed by an orchestra playing traditional mining songs. \u201cThere are signs that the city\u2019s importance will keep growing,\u201d says Link. \u201cWe could become China\u2019s gateway to Europe \u2013 and vice versa.\u201d\n\nThe trains\u2019 return journeys, however, remain Duisburg\u2019s achilles heel. For every two full containers arriving in Europe from China, only one heads back the other way, and the port only earns a fifth of the fee from empty containers that have to be sent back to China.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Krupp steelworkers occupying a bridge over the Rhine in 1987. Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images\n\nAnd while the west\u2019s appetite for gadgets made in China shows no sign of abating, one of the main European products heading east is powdered milk \u2013 a result of low trust in domestic brands following a 2008 food safety scandal. If that trust returns, even fewer containers may be heading east from Duisburg.\n\n\u201cThe ratio used to be 4:1, so it has improved, but we still have an imbalance,\u201d admits Erich Staake, the port\u2019s CEO. A former TV channel manager, he is not shy to take credit for the entrepreneurial spirit of the port. Since taking charge in 1998, employment at Duisport has soared from 19,000 to 50,000.\n\nWhile other German port cities such as Hamburg run their harbour \u201clike a landlord\u201d, Staake says, Duisburg has worked to court new trade, modernising its logistics infrastructure and even setting up its own railway company. He is building a new 20,000 sq metre storage unit where China Railways will be able to neatly stack 2,000 containers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chinese President Xi Jinping Visits Duisburg in 2014 and welcomes the arrival of the Yuxinou container train, linking Duisburg directly with Chongqing. Photograph: Pool/Getty Images\n\nStaake\u2019s aspiration doesn\u2019t stop there. For Duisburg to permanently establish itself on the New Silk Road, he says, rail travel between China and Europe needs to outstrip other freight methods.\n\n\u201cRail freight between Chongqing and Duisburg is almost twice as expensive as shipping, but takes 12 days instead of 45. Air freight is at least twice as expensive as rail freight, but takes on average five days. If we can reduce lead times even further, below 10 days on average, then that opens up a lot more potential.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s good for Duisburg isn\u2019t necessarily good for the world Jonas Schaible, T Online\n\nBut in Germany, some have been quick to sound a note of caution. If the still-recovering industries in western Germany make themselves too reliant on China, they warn, it could provide economic leverage for an authoritarian regime that wants to project its geopolitical power into western Europe. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for Duisburg isn\u2019t necessarily good for the world,\u201d cautioned one recent article.\n\nFor now though, China\u2019s soft power barely registers in the region. The number of Chinese citizens living in the city has doubled in the past eight years \u2013 but from a low base of 568. The local Duisburg-Essen University houses a Confucius Institute and attracts the largest number of Chinese students in Germany, most of whom study engineering and economic sciences. They support a growing network of relatively authentic Asian fast food joints which now compete with the kebab houses introduced by a previous generation of migrants.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eighty percent of trains from China make Duisburg their first European stop. Photograph: Hans Blossey/\u00a9 duisport\n\nThe number of Chinese businesses in the city has risen, too \u2013 up 50% since Xi visited in 2014 \u2013 but, again, there are still only 90. Unlike other cities on the New Silk Road, the port remains German-run.\n\nThe reasons journey times from China are still far too long, as Staake sees it, lie mainly with the heavily unionised rail companies in Europe rather than their counterparts in Asia: trains take on average six days to travel the 1,300km (800 miles) from Brest on the Polish-Belarusian border to Duisburg, while the 10,000km from Chongqing to Belarus is often completed in five-and-a-half days.\n\nFollow the New Silk Road Read more\n\n\u201cThe Chinese and the Kazakhs drive thousands of kilometres a day, they really work hard. It\u2019s ridiculous, really. Of course we are trying to work out why this is happening. You know how many train drivers\u2019 unions we have, and the Poles are not much better,\u201d says Staake.\n\nAt the Duisburg city museum, visitors can still listen to the chants and jeers of the workers who went on strike over the closure of the steelworks in the 1980s and early 90s. A button hidden inside a wall made of original Ruhr valley coal triggers a recording. The modern Duisburg port with all its modern marvel, however, has yet to find its place in the city\u2019s memory.\n\nIn the entrance hall to the museum, a wall greets visitors with the words for \u201cwelcome\u201d in the languages of all the migrant workers who have shaped the city, from Kurdish to Greek to Polish. For now, the Mandarin or Cantonese phrases for \u201cwelcome\u201d do not feature.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here", "sentiment": 0.12623278688524592, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Germany's 'China City': how Duisburg became Xi Jinping's gateway to Europe"}, {"published": "2015-11-10T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/10/hope-in-the-heart-of-apache-territory-mexico-citys-deportivo-chavos-banda", "text": "A community centre that originated from a land-grab by gang members in a suburb infamous for high crime now offers an all-too-rare chance to escape the pressures of the past, and carve out a brighter future for Mexico City\n\n\u201cI remember the dawns after a rainy day.

Of the estimated 1.8 million inhabitants of Iztapalapa, which covers an area of 117sw km, 35% live in conditions of poverty.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Life on the edge in Iztapalapa. The area was completely rural until four decades ago. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nIn a recent article in El Universal, the journalist H\u00e9ctor de Maule\u00f3n states that 18% of the city\u2019s prisoners had lived in Iztapalapa before they were jailed. In the Desarrollo Urbano Quetzalc\u00f3atl district alone \u2014 one of the most dangerous in the city, and bordering the Deportivo Chavos Banda \u2014 more than 66,000 people live in an area covering 567 blocks. De Maule\u00f3n explains: \u201cSome 39% of the houses [in this area] have just one bedroom. Within these chaotic streets you\u2019ll find two markets, two hospitals, five churches, 48 schools and 453 establishments selling alcohol.\u201d Many of these establishments tiran vicio \u2013 meaning that, behind the facade of a typical corner shop, the owners also peddle all kinds of illegal drugs.\n\nSince the former president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, declared war on the cartels in 2006, there have been tens of thousands of killings in Mexico, but the Federal District has continued to be seen as safe haven against violence by the traffickers. But in recent weeks, a spate of grizzly murders in Iztapalapa appears to have put paid to the city\u2019s official discourse that organised crime doesn\u2019t operate in any consistent way in the city.\n\nWalking through the streets surrounding the Deportivo , we arrive at an alleyway that marks the boundary of a marginal area known as the Barrio Negro.

It is plastered with advertisements for classes: life drawing, guitar, baking, dance, English lessons, capoeira, a beauty school, personal defence, fabric painting, zumba and kung fu \u2013 the list is endless. Inside, the first thing you see is a street post with signs that resemble road names: \u201cBe kind\u201d, \u201cRespect\u201d, \u201cLook out for one another\u201d, \u201cShare\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adverts for all the classes on offer as part of the arts, sports and education programme.

Behind that is a pro-sized football pitch \u2013 albeit one without grass \u2013 encircled by a running track, which is always the first facility to be used each day: at around 6am, as the sky awaits the first rays of light, around a dozen women come to pace around the track.\n\nThe complex covers two and a half acres. The first of its two buildings contains a small library, an internet room and an administrative office with two signs on the window: \u201cNo gossiping\u201d and \u201cThe only thing we don\u2019t have here is fear.\u201d The other, newer building is where all those advertised classes take place.\n\nEach Saturday at 1pm, Juan Ram\u00f3n Navarro teaches life drawing in the multi-use classroom. On the desk, along with some impressive sketches of faces, are several drawings of female nudes and a copy of The Labyrinth of Solitude by Mexico\u2019s Nobel laureate for literature, Octavio Paz.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A student at the Deportivo\u2019s fine arts class. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nWhen I ask why the book is there, Navarro immediately turns to a page with a quote highlighted in yellow: \u201cRub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, like all the other great poets, considered women to be not only an instrument of knowledge but knowledge itself. It is a knowledge we will never possess, the sum of our definitive ignorance: the supreme mystery.\u201d\n\nHe explains: \u201c[That is] to help my students understand why we draw female nudes. I use books as a way for my students to organise their thoughts and ideas, and clear their minds. You can\u2019t draw if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your head, or if you don\u2019t let it flow unobstructed.\u201d\n\nMaximiliano Jim\u00e9nez, one of Navarro\u2019s students, is holding Michael Ende\u2019s book, The Legend of the Full Moon. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this because the maestro is here, because I\u2019d never say anything I don\u2019t think, but what I\u2019ve learned more than anything from him isn\u2019t how to draw, but how to look, to observe different realities \u2013 to see the world through different eyes.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Ram\u00f3n Navarro, teacher of the fine arts class. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nJim\u00e9nez is 19, and Navarro, his tutor, just 27. Helping the local Iztapalapa community to see the world through different eyes is precisely the goal of Deportivo Chavos Banda, whose next project is to build a cinema room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like this venue to form part of the city\u2019s main cultural line-up,\u201d says Dur\u00e1n, better known as El Flaco (meaning \u201cLanky\u201d). \u201cWhat we do here doesn\u2019t just have an effect on the people who come: it helps to change mentalities further afield. The young men and women who come here see that things can be different, that they can be done properly. They\u2019re free to be themselves here and explore their talents, which means they go back out there with a new attitude.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only young men and women who use the Deportivo. In addition to the women who start their day striding around the football pitch, older women can also attend classes. When we drop in on a fitness session, the female instructor, displaying some of the lively spirit you find all over the centre, shouts: \u201cCome on, slackers! I want to see you opening and closing those legs as if these boys were on top of you.\u201d\n\nGang culture\n\nDespite being known colloquially as the Deportivo Chavos Banda, the initials BUI are engraved on one of the pillars at the main entrance. The full name, Bandas Unidas Iztapalapa (United Gangs of Iztapalapa), carries both symbolic and historical weight: the Deportivo is the outcome of a pact between Iztapalapa\u2019s gangs, who organised themselves firstly to call a truce in the face of the street crime that was ravaging the area in the late 80s and early 90s; and secondly, to demand that the government provide them with a space where they could gather, away from the violence. The plot was a wasteground that served as a boundary line between two of the area\u2019s most violent gangs: Los Dragones (\u201cThe Dragons\u201d) and Las Ratitas Punk (\u201cThe Punk Rats\u201d).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boys rest during a break in a basketball match. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nBut to fully understand the gang phenomenon in Mexico City, one must go back to the start of the 1980s, the decade in which the best known gang of all, Los Panchitos (heavily influenced by New York punk band The Ramones), was at its height, spreading terror and disorder among the city\u2019s more comfortable and conservative classes. Carlos Hank Gonz\u00e1lez \u2013 who coined the phrase \u201cA poor politician is a bad politician\u201d \u2013 was then the city\u2019s governor; he pulled off some wildly lucrative deals, developed a vast network of arterial roads known as ejes viales, and simultaneously demolished most of the streets with central reservations, setting in motion a public policy that still snubs pedestrians and cyclists to this day.\n\nThe chief of police was Arturo \u201cEl Negro\u201d Durazo, infamous for his fierce politics of extortion and torture, and who would later be imprisoned for eight years (Durazo was linked to major drug traffickers such as Rafael \u201cCaro\u201d Quintero). Back then, many young people in Mexico, a country perpetually lacking in opportunities, discovered in gangs what they found nowhere else: a sense of belonging and a safe haven.\n\nDur\u00e1n grew up during the height of the gang culture. \u201cThe violence inevitably catches up with you, and there\u2019s no alternative: you have to defend yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cThe street is the jungle, and it\u2019s one hell of a jungle.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberto Dur\u00e1n, founder of the Deportivo, who has lived in the area since he was five. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only on the streets that Dur\u00e1n learned this lesson: his father showed the young Roberto that in life you should do anything but cower. Dur\u00e1n holds a mixture of fear and respect for his father. His own son, he says, has had a different kind of education: friendlier and more attentive, less marked by tension and violence. Yet, he is grateful to his father: \u201cMuch of what I am I owe to him.\u201d\n\n\n\nBetween the ages of 14 and 25, Dur\u00e1n spent most of his time on the streets. \u201cBeing on the street with the gang means devoting yourself to vice, to wickedness,\u201d he admits. Three things saved him from the fate of his friends, almost all of whom are now dead or in prison. Firstly, his talent on a football pitch: not only did the game sustain him financially for several years (the gangs placed bets on matches against other neighbourhoods), it allowed him to get to know people from other gangs, as his skills on the pitch were in constant demand, even from supposed rivals. Secondly: his father\u2019s experience in the military, police force and boxing ring (he was from Tacubaya, a boxing neighbourhood), combined with Dur\u00e1n\u2019s early lessons in Tae Kwon Do, made him a figure few wanted to cross.\n\n\n\nThirdly, and most importantly: his thirst for knowledge. A qualified lawyer, Dur\u00e1n is one of few Deportivo members to have gained a university degree. (Another, Mario Urbina L\u00f3pez \u2013 a certified public accountant \u2013 is the centre\u2019s administrator and is on the board of directors.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Deportivo in earlier days. The community centre was founded on an area of wasteground that originally served as a boundary between rival gangs. Photograph: Roberto Dur\u00e1n\n\n\u201cBeing in the gang, I saw [school] as a kind of \u2018time-out\u2019 from the \u2019hood,\u201d Dur\u00e1n says. \u201cThe \u2019hood teaches you restraint. If you spend a lot of time on the street, eventually you\u2019re going to come across someone tougher than you, and you\u2019re always going to be at risk. The less time you spend on the street, the less at risk you are.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd this is the driving idea behind the Deportivo. In providing a refuge for people of all ages and offering them activities to keep them off the street, the centre represents a fundamental change for the community; a sanctuary that upsets the ecosystem of the streets. Within its walls, people can feel safe and think for themselves, two luxuries in the hood.\n\nBy 1991, Dur\u00e1n had become the go-to guy whenever a gang member had any kind of administrative task to take care of. Dur\u00e1n could hold his own with politicians, read the charges made against his friends, and answer letters.\n\nOn the day that would change his live forever, some gang members asked him to go with them to talk to Manuel Camacho Sol\u00eds, Mexico City\u2019s then chief of department (the second highest authority in the city), who was due to hold a meeting in the area. What Dur\u00e1n didn\u2019t know was that the plan of that 50-strong group (\u201cpeople who\u2019d make your hair stand on end; the types you look into their eyes and know they\u2019ve killed someone\u201d) was to take Camacho Sol\u00eds by force and demand the plot of land where the Deportivo now stands be handed over to them. Given their advantage in numbers, the official\u2019s bodyguards could do nothing to stop them taking him.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the disused plot, the police had been notified \u2013 it required a call from Camacho Sol\u00eds to reassure the forces everything was OK. Dur\u00e1n describes him telling the gang: \u201cYou know what, lads, I\u2019m going to help you. I thought my days were numbered. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way but \u2026 take a look at yourselves in the mirror!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Deportivo\u2019s pro-sized football pitch as it looks now.

What they didn\u2019t realise was that the government had no right to pass the land on to them: it was private property. By the time the owner found out what had happened, however, it was too late to do anything about it.\n\nAround the time of the land grab, two of Dur\u00e1n\u2019s friends were killed in clashes with rival gangs \u2013 one \u201cin a fight where [the gang] split into two groups. I went with one and he with the other, where he was fucked up real bad. They really butchered him: a hundred bullets all over his body. They ripped open his stomach, but they didn\u2019t kill him there. He died in front of us, desperate with no way of saving him, about 10 minutes later. Heavy shit.\u201d\n\nThe other friend had been standing on a street corner waiting for Dur\u00e1n, who didn\u2019t show up because he decided at the last minute to go with another friend who wanted to settle a score with a guy who had stolen his girlfriend. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened if I\u2019d have been there. I guess they would have done the same to me as they did to him, to make sure there were no witnesses or something. He was killed brutally, too.\u201d\n\nPolitical deals\n\nStrictly speaking, the land on which the Deportivo stands is still illegally occupied \u2013 but few spaces can have been appropriated for more honourable purposes: a privately-owned former rubbish dump, used by the gangs to host their ruckuses, now belongs to the community and provides hundreds of local people with services that would otherwise be unavailable; unthinkable, even.\n\nSince the land belonged neither to the government nor its occupants, however, for a long time any federal support had to be kept under wraps. In those days, the conservative Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) served as an extension of the government, carrying out the functions the state couldn\u2019t authorise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Graffiti artist Koka Lep began his career at one of the Deportivo\u2019s early expos. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nDur\u00e1n remembers that institutional relations were almost always with the PRI, who, in exchange for being allowed a presence at official events, or, worse still, for clandestine services as agitators, provided them with building materials, put up temporary classrooms, and even donated cans of spray paint, once the Deportivo had begun to be considered an important centre for urban art. To justify their purchase, the paint was in the colours of the PRI: green, white, red and black.\n\nOn one occasion, the Deportivo received a donation of 10,000 cans, which \u201cwe took to stationers and paint shops in the neighbourhood to exchange for cans in all different colours\u201d, says Dur\u00e1n. \u201cTwo of ours for one of theirs.\u201d Once they realised they had enough cans to paint the entire Deportivo, they had their first brainwave: they would organise a graffiti expo, with ska and hip-hop concerts to liven things up.\n\n\n\nFor 17 years, Expo Chavos Banda was one of the most important cultural and musical events in the city \u2013 although, of course, due to its location and profile, it was always considered \u201cunderground\u201d. The graffiti artist Taria remembers: \u201cYou had to be in line at seven in the morning to get a tiny part of a wall to paint, but it didn\u2019t matter, all the artists wanted to be there. It was worth the early start too, because the rest of the day you just messed around with the others.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Deportivo has become known for its urban art and graffiti expos; in the early days artists made do with donated paint in the colours of the ruling PRI party. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nKoka Lep, now an internationally recognised graffiti artist, recalls being invited to one of the expos to do a mural, \u201cbecause they knew I painted well, and I was into painting with aerosols\u201d. The result was so spectacular that Koka hasn\u2019t been out of work since, becoming one of the city\u2019s first professional urban artists.\n\nBut still the Deportivo had to think on its feet to survive. Despite benefiting from some public funding, such as the money received for several years via the neighbourhood improvement community programme, it has had to come up with its own fundraising methods to survive in the face of the discretionary, arbitrary and sometimes corrupt use of public money in Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe UN awarded a grant of $10,000 for the airbrushes needed to set up the first workshop, and the Deportivo has received support from other international institutions, such as Deutsche Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. But partnerships such as with Fundaci\u00f3n Alumnos 47 (FA47) \u2013 a Mexico City-based foundation that has contributed to the construction of the building where classes are held \u2013 have been key to the development of the Deportivo, even if they don\u2019t always manifest themselves directly in improvements to the centre.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, FA47 sponsored a draft bill to make the Deportivo a self-sustaining and ecological centre \u2013 but lack of resources meant it never got off the ground. In front of the main entrance is a wall full of political propaganda: \u201cMore support for urban artists,\u201d it reads. But as with most things related to Mexican politics, the facade appears little more than an empty promise.\n\nOasis of opportunity\n\nToday, the Agrarista district that includes Deportivo Chavos Banda is labelled by the police as a \u201cred spot\u201d. This means that undercover police enter the Deportivo, and that operations and arrests take place across the whole district.\n\nThe battle between the people of Iztapalapa and the law enforcement agencies goes back further than anyone can remember, and it\u2019s not always the police who win. On one occasion, mounted police officers were stripped of their uniforms and horses after beating one of the members of the \u201cLos Chupones\u201d gang. A senior commander had to come along to negotiate the animals\u2019 return (\u201cwe held on to the uniforms just to piss them off,\u201d Dur\u00e1n tells me).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hip-hop group Sant\u00edsimo Barrio works with youths in the neighbourhood.\n\nConscious of this ancient antagonism, and of the fact that the police are often complicit in all kinds of crimes, the Expo Chavos Banda exhibitions are self-policed. \u201cOf course, people can bring along their beers or their joints, but if they cross the line, it\u2019s us who handles it.\u201d How? \u201cWith a little slap on the wrist,\u201d says Dur\u00e1n, with a wry smile that belies his understatement.\n\n\n\nNo stranger to this disciplinary approach is \u00d3scar Flores Carranza, better known as \u201cZaga\u201d, a founding member of the hip-hop group Sant\u00edsimo Barrio and producer of one of the most important rap events in Mexico, Retumba el Barrio.\n\n\n\nZaga had been toying with the idea of approaching Dur\u00e1n for some time before finally getting his chance during one the graffiti expos: \u201cOne time there was an expo and they didn\u2019t have a master of ceremonies, and since I\u2019ve always had a way with words, I did it. That day they invited me for a beer, as a kind of payment. But I\u2019d had one too many by then and I was really fucking out of it.\u201d\n\nZaga thought that he\u2019d ruined his chances of taking part in the next expo \u2013 but not long after, the city\u2019s governor announced a competition to write a song in any genre, using the open government information services at their disposal. Dur\u00e1n asked Zaga to take part, and Sant\u00edsimo Barrio won the competition.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fernanda Rodr\u00edguez, Melod\u00eda del Santo Barrio, belongs to the hip-hop collective and gives workshops. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nBoth Zaga and MC Melod\u00eda, the only woman in the group and one of very few in Mexico\u2019s hip-hop scene, devote a good part of their lives to the hip-hop collective, but they\u2019re more motivated by the idea of using music to help others in their community.\n\n\n\n\u201cI get the gang kids. I don\u2019t justify their behaviour, but I get that that\u2019s how they grew up. They haven\u2019t had any option,\u201d says Melod\u00eda, despite having herself been threatened by gangs. The boss of a zone she once wandered into without authorisation held her at gunpoint: \u201cIt was pretty heavy at first, but then a guy I know came along and recognised me, and he managed to calm things down. We even stayed talking with them there once things were cool. It\u2019s weird, but things can change from one minute to the next like that.\u201d\n\nBoth teach at the Deportivo, and go to a lot of effort to make time for the people who approach them. \u201cMusic helped us to channel our emotions and experiences,\u201d Zaga says, \u201cand in the workshops I\u2019ve been able to connect with a lot of brothers and sisters that way. There\u2019s a lot of mutual understanding in the classes, and that makes kids want to follow our lead. They see it doesn\u2019t have to be all madness and beef.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile music was the precursor to everything the Deportivo Chavos Banda is today, the musical events there were not always artistically driven. In 1995, Dur\u00e1n organised the first event called Misa Rock (Rock Mass). It was a reaction to what Dur\u00e1n had seen happening in a rival neighbourhood called Las Espinas (\u201cThe Thorns\u201d), where every year a gig was held to mark the anniversary of the gang that controlled the area. Dur\u00e1n didn\u2019t want to hold an event celebrating the culture of violence, but rather one that reflected upon its consequences.\n\n\u201cWhen I first told them about my idea of putting on a rock concert including a mass for the dead, the imprisoned and the disappeared, the gang were sceptical, but others were up for it and we went for it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Religion has featured in surprising ways at events organised by the Deportivo, which put on a \u2018Rock Mass\u2019 for the dead, disappeared and imprisoned. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nThe only person capable of leading such an event was Padre Chinchachoma, described as, \u201can angelic bastard, a dude well and truly on another level\u201d. Fr Chinchachoma spoke to the \u2019hood in their language, and they \u201cspoke to him with a respect they didn\u2019t even show their own father\u201d.\n\n\n\nAccording to urban legend, Chinchachoma had been excommunicated from the Catholic Church \u2013 but during Misa Rock, he managed to tame between 1,500 and 2,000 punks who had come for the gigs. \u201cFr Chinchachoma understood that you can\u2019t come around here if you don\u2019t respect how the gang is. And he was respectful.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow do you deal with the gang? Exactly how he did. He began mass by saying, \u2018Put down your weed, put down your beer, put down your sniff, and you\u2019re going give the boss a few minutes of your time.\u2019 Then he\u2019d talk to the gang in their language, and they all listened. I watched the hardest punks hold each other\u2019s hands during the sign of peace, on their knees. A crazy catharsis fell over the place, and you watched even the hardest among them in tears. That\u2019s when you realise that the gang has stuff going on in their heart, just no way of getting it out.\u201d\n\nDespite being universally recognised as an oasis of opportunities in a desert, the excesses of some events at the Deportivo have raised eyebrows among some locals. And yet, the general view is overwhelmingly positive. \u201cIn the end, I learned the hard way that peace is respecting the rights of others, and that is what we try to instil here, especially in the new generations,\u201d says Dur\u00e1n. \u201cWe never know what talent we might be uncovering.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Carlos Mart\u00ednez, known as the \u2018Vampire\u2019, trains gang youth in a sport that has developed in prisons, known as \u2018the bar\u2019. Photograph: Xareni Penichet\n\nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Mexico has the worst levels of education among its members. And education in Mexico isn\u2019t just bad; it\u2019s also a luxury. In 2015, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the country\u2019s most highly celebrated educational institution, accepted just 8.9% of applicants. Of the 128,519 students who took the entrance exam, only 11,490 were given a place. The educational and formative work of centres offering an alternative to formal education is essential in a country where 54 million people live below the poverty line.\n\nIn this context, the Deportivo constitutes a rare space where there\u2019s room for all. Nowhere is the importance of this outlook clearer than in a figure like Juan Carlos Mart\u00ednez Mart\u00ednez, aka El Vampiro (\u201cThe Vampire\u201d), a five-time district champion of the bar \u2013 a sport that combines weights, gymnastics and circus acrobatics, and which originates from the country\u2019s prisons.\n\nEl Vampiro is a leading figure in this sport, and has played a major role in the transformation of personalities like El Gato (\u201cThe Cat\u201d), an 18-year-old boy who has just finished a three-year prison sentence for assault with a firearm.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t exclude the gang boys,\u201d El Vampiro says. \u201cImagine one of these fellas comes up to you high as a kite and he wants to try the bar; I\u2019m not going to judge him or lay down rules. If someone comes along in that kind of state and you don\u2019t let him in, well, it\u2019s you and you alone who are blocking his chance. So I say let them come as they are, and I\u2019ll accept them and let them have a go and support them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zaga, founder member of Sant\u00edsimo Barrio and producer of one of Mexico\u2019s most important rap events. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nEl Vampiro is another rare rehabilitation case within the Deportivo. At just 14, he enlisted in the army, where he joined the special forces. Despite his military background, not only did El Vampiro not leave the street gang, but his status, discipline and military knowledge gave him a power that for many years he used for violent purposes. \u201cI was like the gang\u2019s attack dog,\u201d he tells me, before confessing to having had a brutal alcohol and drug addiction before his \u201cproblem\u201d \u2013 a common euphemism for prison.\n\n\u201cPrison is the best thing that can happen to a drug addict, because you can do what you like there. No one is going to judge you and there are no limits,\u201d says El Vampiro, adding that he lived amid permanent overcrowding, \u201cand that\u2019s serious shit, because there\u2019s nowhere to run in there. If you get into any kind of argument one night, you have to get back to your yard \u2013 no matter what.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat prison gives you is all the time in the world,\u201d says H\u00e9ctor Sol\u00eds, a fellow member of El Vampiro\u2019s bar team. Sol\u00eds lost three years of his life in the Reclusorio Sur (South Prison) and, like El Vampiro, he used the bar as a means to pass the time. \u201cIt destressed me, kept me out of trouble and away from temptation, because there\u2019s a permanent tension in there. Your life is in the balance every second of every day. You never know when a look, the wrong gesture, someone\u2019s bad trip can wind up finishing you off.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaving brushed with death as a result of his addictions, El Vampiro transformed his life thanks to his strict discipline at the bar. Today, he\u2019s almost twice the weight he was on entering prison (45kg), and he spends his time helping to rehabilitate addicts and anyone who wants to promote the sport to which he is devoted, and the place he considers home, Deportivo Chavos Banda.\n\nView from afar\n\nHaving seen the inner workings of the Deportivo; having had long conversations with its founders, participants and protagonists, I felt there there was still one angle missing before I could understand the implications of a space in a place like Iztapalapa: a panoramic view.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The view of Iztapalapa from Molcajete hill. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nGuided by Roberto Dom\u00ednguez, known in the neighbourhood as Tablota (\u201cPlank\u201d) for his imposing stature and physique, we set out from the Deportivo at 6am to catch the sunrise from the top of the Molcajete hill. Sa\u00fal and Mois\u00e9s, the music teacher, join our convoy headed for the border of Iztapalapa and Tl\u00e1huac.\n\nWe park up in front of an immense altar where Our Lady of the Holy Death and a picture of Jes\u00fas Malverde (also known as the angel of the poor, and the unofficial patron saint of drug traffickers) rest side by side. There we wait for G\u00fcero, Tablota\u2019s younger brother, and his uncommonly affectionate and timid pitbull, Tom\u00e1s. Then we walk through a district that, like so many in Iztapalapa, looks like a building site, before eventually arriving at the foot of the hill.\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at the floor, pure fucking gravel \u2013 that\u2019s why they\u2019re tearing the hill to pieces,\u201d Tablota explains, as we wind our way through the undergrowth. For an inexpert walker, gravel is only a slightly lesser version of quicksand. The climb puts intermittent stops to the team\u2019s banter as we are forced to catch our breath.\n\nAs the day unfolds, and light tones of pink and blue begin to mark out the surrounding contours, we see that on one side of our route up is a huge chasm, caused by the machines that continually extract building material from this hill. \u201cAt this rate, in a few years, adi\u00f3s hill!\u201d G\u00fcero says.\n\nThe climb isn\u2019t without its hazards: a few wobbles near the thousand-metre sheer drop mean the group\u2019s jokes are replaced by a supportive silence. In the distance, a myriad twinkling lights shine like the burning embers of a dying fire. When we reach the top, the light seems to bend in the sky, and a deceptive sense of harmony engulfs the landscape.\n\n\u201cSee over there? That\u2019s the lost city in San Juan. It looks like a Brazilian favela, properly dense. And look over there. That\u2019s the Frente Francisco Villa. Some parts of that district are fenced,\u201d G\u00fcero tells me. \u201cTo protect them from thieves?\u201d I ask. \u201cNo! More like the rats fence them in.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tablota takes the first turn at rolling down the steep gravel slope leading from Molcajete hill to Iztapalapa. Photograph: Santiago Arau\n\nOur spectacular view is misleading: in the surrounding districts, life is anything but harmonious. The clear signs of further sprawl and overcrowding make it harder to breathe: the air seems to thicken. But then, turning around, we notice how on the other side of this small, slowly crumbling hill, there are still green cornfields and sizeable expanses of land: a flashback to the Iztapalapa of 30 years ago, where frogs and toads hid under rocks, and Mexican salamanders swam in the canals formed by flooded dirt roads.\n\nSoon it is time find a way back down the steep gravel slope. Tablota has been anticipating this moment since the start of the expedition, so we grant him the honour of being the first down. The image of a bulky man well over 6ft tall laughing and rolling down the slope sums up what the Deportivo has been able to do for its people: give them back their right to happiness.\n\n\n\nBefore joining the Deportivo, Tablota had been suffering from alcoholism, an addiction that landed him in prison. After a hard day\u2019s drinking in one of the lost cities on the edge of the hill, he collapsed in the street. Hours later, he was brought back to consciousness by the emergency lights of a police car. Two young kids sprinted past him. When the police arrived at the spot where Tablota lay semi-conscious, they decided it would be him who paid the price for the robbery of an old stereo and 50 pesos, which had taken place a few blocks away.\n\nTablota spent a year inside, and only got out when a judge deigned to deal with his case: in the face of the flagrant absence of any evidence, he was released. . \u201cI always wanted to belong to something, to be part of a group. Before, the only option was in the street. That\u2019s not the case any more,\u201d Tablota says.\n\nFrom micro to macro: visual artist Melanie Smith's mind-altering guide to Mexico City Read more\n\nAll around the Deportivo Chavos Banda, individual men, women and families exist under the protection of a community that nurtures as much as it teaches its members. The capoeira teacher, for example, returns to the Deportivo many years after having attended the drawing classes that \u201cmarked [his] childhood\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe long-term aim is for this place to run itself; for it to have a life of its own,\u201d Dur\u00e1n tells me. It is clear there is a long way to go before that dream is realised, but they\u2019re headed in the right direction.\n\nThis revolutionary centre represents one of the few effective antidotes to the daily struggles of life in Mexico City\u2019s suburbs \u2013 where bad planning, corruption and bouts of violence have numbed people\u2019s faith and expectations.

It has contributed to shaping our rules over the last 45 years. And yet, some UK proposals would undermine our single market, which is one of the EU\u2019s biggest achievements.\n\n\u201cThe UK wants to keep free movement of goods between us, but not of people and services. And it proposes to apply EU customs rules without being part of the EU\u2019s legal order. Thus, the UK wants to take back sovereignty and control of its own laws, which we respect, but it cannot ask the EU to lose control of its borders and laws.\u201d\n\nThe article will be seen as a direct rebuff to attempts by the British cabinet to persuade individual EU leaders and Europea business leaders to back the UK vision.\n\nHe writes of being hopeful of a deal being struck but suggests that the basic free trade agreement lifting tariffs on goods, alongside a security deal, is the best offer he can make.\n\nBarnier\u2019s line is a familiar one in Whitehall, but the publication of his article is incendiary given the push in recent days by May and her cabinet to try and forge a new approach to the negotiations with the EU27 states.\n\nGerman sources deny Brexit deal offer amid warning from pro-EU camp Read more\n\nThe British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, met his counterparts in France and Austria to warn that the UK was on course for an \u201caccidental no deal\u201d if the EU did not rethink its rejection of the white paper, thrashed out at great political cost at Chequers. The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, was in Paris on Thursday to see Nathalie Loiseau, the French minister for European affairs.\n\nRaab tweeted: \u201cI had a warm and constructive first meeting with French Europe Minister @NathalieLoiseau. We discussed the progress of negotiations with Michel Barnier, the proposals in our White Paper and our shared commitment to work closely together\u201d.\n\nLoiseau tweeted in response: \u201cSupport #MichelBarnier, need to AGREE without delay an orderly withdrawal that respects the commitments made, wishes for a close and future balanced relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom: many topics of discussion.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, May is cutting short the first leg of her holiday to meet France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, at Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on, his state residence on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur.\n\nA spokesman for Macron said Friday\u2019s talks between the two leaders would not constitute a negotiation nor substitute for talks led by Barnier. The spokesman added that Macron had full trust in Barnier\u2019s position on the UK white paper.\n\nBarnier insisted in his article that he is not going beyond his mandate in ruling out the UK\u2019s proposal for free trade in goods, based on a common rulebook on standards, but is reflecting the position of the 27 capitals for whom he works.\n\nBarnier writes: \u201cLet\u2019s be frank: as the UK has decided to leave the single market, it can no longer be as close economically to the rest of the EU.\n\n\u201cThe UK wants to leave our common regulatory area, where people, goods, services and capital move freely across national borders. These are the economic foundations on which the EU was built.

Earlier this week, The Guardian revealed that the declaration is likely to be short and relatively vague, reflecting a belief that a detailed paper would only be shot down in parliament.\n\nBarnier writes: \u201cSince we will not know what the future relationship will bring by autumn 2018, we need to have a backstop solution in the withdrawal agreement.\n\n\u201cThe UK agrees with this, and both the EU and the UK have said that a better solution in the future relationship could replace the backstop.\n\n\u201cWhat the EU has proposed is that Northern Ireland remains in a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU.

His main competitor, Adam Putnam, a rising star in Florida politics, had more local endorsements and had raised more money, $19.2m by April of this year.\n\nThen came Donald Trump. On 22 June, Trump tweeted his endorsement of DeSantis, and the polls flipped almost overnight. Real Clear Politics now gives DeSantis around an 11-point lead.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders, tough on Crime & big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military & our Vets. He will be a Great Governor & has my full Endorsement!\n\nEarlier this week Trump once again endorsed DeSantis, this time onstage with him at a rally in Tampa. DeSantis gave a fawning introduction to Trump in which he praised his leadership and policies.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s support and the resulting turnaround in polling has left DeSantis with a new challenge: how do you build a whole gubernatorial campaign around basically one point \u2013 that you have the endorsement of the president?\n\nThe answer the campaign has come up with is to double down and then double down again. Trump is everywhere in DeSantis\u2019s campaigning material, mentioned every other sentence in his speeches. The description text of his website, the bit that comes up in Google search results, simply reads: \u201cRon DeSantis if [sic] fully endorsed by President Donald Trump!\u201d\n\nIt could be easy to mock DeSantis for his lapdog behaviour, but he\u2019s done that already. In a new campaign ad he playfully jokes about the only thing to his candidacy is his close relationship with the president.\n\nIn the ad, DeSantis\u2019s wife assures viewers that there\u2019s more to the candidate than his close association with Trump \u2013 he plays with his children and teaches them to read. But in footage of the candidate with his kids, we see he\u2019 is reading them The Art of the Deal and building a border wall out of toy bricks.\n\nHumourous campaign ads have a tortured history. Many are so laboured that they make you want to wince, rather than laugh. Democrat Dan Helmer\u2019s Top Gun parody, which aired during his congressional campaign, is common of the kind of awkward dad humour involved.\n\nYet DeSantis\u2019s ad feels genuinely funny. The production values are high, the gag is relatively edgy: that he\u2019s indoctrinating his young children into Trumpism. It\u2019s not unlike the sort of skit you might see on John Oliver, or perhaps something Sacha Baron Cohen might trick a politician into on Who Is America?. Liberals might be unable to fathom how this could make voters more likely to vote for DeSantis, yet he clearly feels confident that he\u2019s not the butt of the joke.\n\nThe ad serves as a reminder of Trump\u2019s soaring approval ratings among Republican voters, and how difficult it will be for some Republican candidates to win races if they distance themselves from the White House.\n\nDeSantis even seems well prepared for the backlash. He has come under some criticism for using his young children, but on Fox News he said such comments just show people have \u201cno sense of humor\u201d \u2013 a line that will surely further please a base that rails against political correctness.", "sentiment": 0.33642857142857147, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Watch this mini Trump campaign ad: it is surprisingly (and disturbingly) funny"}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/01/brazil-graffiti-artist-sao-paulo", "text": "Two pixadores tagging a building were shot dead by police.

To tag your name or to execute someone and hide the evidence?\u201d\n\nIn their testimony, the officers said they had been told the building was being robbed, and that the two men had shot first before they returned fire.\n\n\n\nPolice said they found a revolver and a pistol on the men, as well as stolen goods. Prosecutors argued that that evidence was falsified and the guns had been planted.\n\nJudge D\u00e9bora Faitarone discounted evidence from two other officers who had testified that they had seen two men being held alive on another floor because of what she said was inconsistencies in their testimonies.\n\nThe judge also noted that both victims had criminal records, for stealing and criminal damage. \u201cIt is absolutely believable that the victims were armed,\u201d she said in her ruling.\n\nLawyers for the officers recently said in a statement that no spray paints were found with the dead men, nor was any part of the building painted. \u201cIt was another important victory for the police family,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nBut relatives said the two victims entered the building to tag not to steal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man walks past a wall covered in the street art in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo on 23 March 2017.

The process has been strategically engineered to seem necessary, benign and even inconsequential, but behind the veil, the simple fact is this: the United Kingdom is in the midst of the largest sell-off of common space since the enclosures of the 17th and 18th century, and London is the epicentre of the fire sale.\n\nCities shape our experiences. As we drift through the winding streets of our capital, our mood is affected by the bustling, menacing or inert environments we encounter. Stumbling upon a quiet square in the middle of a busy day can feel like finding water in the desert. In the days and weeks that follow, we might seek that spot instead of chancing across it, making it \u2018ours\u2019 in a meaningful way. Over years living in a city, we all weave mental maps of the squares, parks, paths and gardens where we pause, recharge, and meet. These are our public spaces.\n\n\n\nBecause they are collectively owned we have an expectation public spaces are free, open and available when we need them\n\nEach of these public spaces also holds within them something less tangible: a potential to transform. They transform day-to-day as they are negotiated between dog walkers, footballers and picnickers, and on a larger scale by festivals, performances and protests. In our most desperate moments as a society, we hold these public spaces as a collective body and defend our broader rights from them. In short, democratic values are coded into our public spaces, and it is precisely because they are collectively owned that we have an expectation that they will be free, open and available when we need them, whoever \u201cwe\u201d might be. Public space is a right, not a privilege.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A sign in Paternoster Square rebadged by protesters as Tahrir Square in 2011. Occupy protesters initially camped in the privately owned public space of Paternoster Square, outside the London Stock Exchange. They moved to the steps of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral after police enforced a high court injunction against public access. Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer\n\nIn 2011, the consequences of privatising public land came into sharp focus when Occupy protesters we forced out of Paternoster Square by a court order that revealed that the space was owned by the Mitsubishi Estate Company. It seemed, at the time, too dystopian to be true, that the rules imposed by a corporation could supersede the law of the land.\n\nSoon after, we began hearing about confrontations in other pseudo-public spaces, such as on the land of More London, where City Hall is a public island in a sea of privatised open air space owned by Kuwaiti land barons. It transpires that for the past few decades almost every major redevelopment in London has resulted in the privatisation of public space, including areas around the Olympic Stadium, King\u2019s Cross and Nine Elms.\n\n\n\nLocal councils, straining under austerity measures and desperate to cut maintenance budgets and to release themselves from liability, are not only complicit in the process but refused to provide useful information in response to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from the Guardian, stating they either did not have the resources to respond or that they did not hold the data.\n\n\n\nConsider for a moment what it means to live in a city where the government does not hold information about where public spaces are, nor any records about when or why they have been sold to private developers.\n\nGiven the controversy surrounding the \u00a337.7 million of public money spent on the cancelled Garden Bridge (another pseudo-public space), should the National Audit Office not expand their investigation to ascertain who exactly is behind the enthusiastic sale our public land? Given that last year the government tried (not for the first time) to privatise the Land Registry itself, where this information is held, we are past due in breaking out the tinfoil hats.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest London City Hall is a public island in a sea of privatised open air space owned by Kuwaiti land barons. Photograph: Alamy\n\nIn most of these pseudo-public spaces, the property owners refuse to post what \u201crules\u201d are enforced on the property, meaning that often you only know you breach them when you are told you have done so, and that they may in fact be making them up on the spot. Considering that these rules have been used to preclude protest, journalism and to curtail freedom of speech, as well as to generally exclude fellow citizens including cyclists, skateboarders, buskers and the homeless, how can we perceive of the creation of these spaces as anything but an attack on our fundamental rights as citizens?\n\n\n\nIt is too easy to convince ourselves that when we lose one space we can just use another. If this process continues as it has, there will be a day when all open-air space in London is privately owned, meaning corporations could effectively render protest illegal, a scenario which should send a shudder through even the most conservative observers.\n\n\n\nQuick guide Pseudo-public spaces Show Hide What is a pseudo-public space? Pseudo-public spaces are large squares, parks and thoroughfares that appear to be public but are actually owned and controlled by developers and corporations. They are on the rise in London and many other British cities, as local authorities argue they cannot afford to create or maintain such spaces themselves.\n\nWhat access do members of the public have?\n\nAlthough they are seemingly accessible to members of the public and have the look and feel of public land, these sites \u2013 also known as privately owned public spaces or \u201cPops\u201d \u2013 are not subject to ordinary local authority bylaws but rather governed by restrictions drawn up the landowner and usually enforced by private security companies. What rules govern them? Under existing laws, public access to pseudo-public spaces remains at the discretion of landowners who are allowed to draw up their own rules for \u201cacceptable behaviour\u201d on their sites and alter them at will. They are not obliged to make these rules public.\n\nIndeed, this is not a partisan issue \u2013 there are many angles from which to approach this slow-motion catastrophe and end up equally livid. Be angry because nearly half the country is already owned by 0.06% of the population and furthering that trend is exacerbating social inequality. Be angry because your freedom to do a you please is being constrained by multinational property companies who are often not even based in the UK.\n\nBe angry because corporations do not have the same obligations as councils to care for the environment or the people in it. Be angry because these sell-offs are disproportionately affecting the poor and the young. Be angry because you are not getting a tax rebate from the sale. Be angry because pseudo-public spaces are bad for local business. Be angry because your city is becoming increasingly dull with each redevelopment.\n\n\n\nThis map \u2013 the first-ever comprehensive map of pseudo-public spaces in London \u2013 is not just an attempt to make the liquidation of our collective assets visible, it is also a call to action.\n\nRevealed: the insidious creep of pseudo-public space in London Read more\n\nThere are three things you can do right now. First, get in contact with your local council officers, MP and your mayor, Sadiq Khan, to demand that all new public spaces built are publicly owned, that already-extant pseudo-public space be governed by the law of the land, and ask that the forthcoming London Plan includes a clear steer toward transparency on this issue.\n\nSecond, take it upon yourself to assert the same rights in them as you do in public space, because corporate rules (posted or not) are not laws.\n\nThird, do everything in your power to challenge the secrecy around this issue further by adding to this map, by posting videos of confrontations with private security guards as you try to use these spaces, and by correcting anyone who refers to these areas as \u201cpublic space\u201d or \u201cpublic realm\u201d, because they are about as public as the Shard\u2019s lobby.\n\n\n\nPublic spaces are the organs of a healthy city. In London, this is no luxury. As the rent on our increasingly cramped flats continues to soar, open, accessible, collectively held space becomes even more essential to everyone\u2019s wellbeing. Public space is also our stage for social and political participation; reducing it to just another real-estate commodity is an attack on our rights to the city and must be resisted by every citizen, every day.\n\n\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive", "sentiment": -0.046441818181818195, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "These squares are our squares: be angry about the privatisation of public space"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket/match/2018-08-02/england-cricket-team", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Which would suit him best?\n\nI enter grad school this fall, and plan to upgrade my 2015 MacBook Air. After a lot of research, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to the ThinkPad T480 and the sixth-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon. With modifications and warranties, both fall within my \u20ac1,800 (\u00a31,599) budget, with the T480 being marginally cheaper. However, being a student, portability is a major priority. The X1 is certainly lighter at about 1.2kg, but how much of a difference will this make in practical terms? Keyboard quality is another prerequisite, with reviews proving inconclusive. Which device would be a better bet? Lastly, is it worth upgrading the Core i5-8250U to a Core i7-8550U? My usage will mostly be light \u2013 word processing, note-taking, browsing \u2013 but I intend to keep this laptop at least five years. AB\n\nThese two 14in laptops should not be comparable, because they are based on completely different design philosophies. It\u2019s a testament to the progress made in reducing the size and weight of traditional laptops that they are now surprisingly close.\n\n\n\nThe ThinkPad T480 is a workhorse used mainly in large corporations, not a \u201chero\u201d product like the X1 Carbon. However, this year\u2019s T480 is thinner and lighter to the point where it is within striking distance of the X1 Carbon, even though it will never to catch up. The T480S version is even closer.\n\nMarket speciation\n\nThere\u2019s still a big market for PCs, so they come in different varieties to meet different needs. The market segments include ultraportables, tablets and convertibles, mainstream laptops, all-in-ones and desktop-replacements, gaming laptops and workstations. Each segment also has different price levels, with \u201cvalue\u201d ranges for people watching their pennies (eg Dell Inspiron) and high-performance models for upmarket buyers (eg Dell XPS).\n\nIn Lenovo\u2019s case, the ThinkPad E series (formerly Edge) is the value range, the L models are mainstream and the T range is for the high-end. The X series laptops are ultraportables while the P models are mobile workstations.\n\nThere\u2019s also a split between consumer and business machines. In general, businesses want their laptops to be functional, durable, expandable and repairable. They also prefer stable configurations. They want to buy thousands of laptops that have the same specifications, not consumer laptops that can change every few months.\n\nBoth your picks are high-performance laptops built to American Mil-spec standards. The difference is that the T range is designed to be expandable and repairable, like a traditional business laptop, while the X range makes compromises for portability.\n\nWhy buy a T480?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Lenovo Thinkpad T480. Photograph: Lenovo\n\nThe ThinkPad T480 is designed to be upgradeable and its two memory slots and can support up to 32GB. This would appeal to programmers and to business users who need lots of memory to handle large spreadsheets, databases and similar tasks.\n\nThe T480 has a full drive bay that will take a hard drive, though it often ships with an SSD. You can upgrade the HDD or SSD up to a 1TB SSD, if required. It also has a good collection of ports including Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0, HDMI and SD ports, and an RJ-45 Ethernet port.\n\nLike some other ThinkPads, the T480 has a second \u201cbridge\u201d battery, which is removable: you can carry a spare and swap over when you run out of juice. The battery life isn\u2019t exceptional with two 24Whr batteries: Lenovo claims 13.9 hours. However, you can install a monster 72Whr bridge battery and run for a claimed 30.3 hours in all. Of course, this adds weight, as well as a bulge at the bottom.\n\nAround the start of this century, I used to carry a ThinkPad with two fat batteries and can testify that, if you want really long battery life, it works a treat. But recharging them is a bit of a chore.\n\nThe T480 is a good choice if you need lots of memory, or have to work away from mains power. But these features may add to the thickness (19.95mm) and the weight (from 1.58kg to 1.87kg).\n\nWhy buy an X1 Carbon?\n\nThe X1 Carbon is much more like your MacBook Air in being designed to be as thin and light as possible for its screen size and specification. In fact, at its 1.13kg starting weight, an X1 will be lighter than your 1.34kg Air.\n\nIf you\u2019re carrying it around, you will definitely notice the difference between an X1 and a T480, even if you are young and fit enough not to mind.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon. Photograph: Lenovo\n\nThe X1 is not completely locked down and you can easily remove the back. The memory chips are soldered in, so you\u2019re stuck with what you buy, up to a maximum of 16GB. However, you can swap the SSD for a bigger model, up to 1TB. This might be a worthwhile upgrade one day, if SSD prices continue to tumble.\n\nTo save space and weight, you lose the T480\u2019s drive bay and Ethernet port, and the SD card slot is reduced to a microSD slot. But at least you get two Thunderbolt 3 ports, HDMI and an Ethernet dongle.\n\nAs a MacBook Air user, you will be familiar with the compromises required for an ultraportable laptop. If you found them really frustrating, that would be a reason to go for the T480. If not, the X1 Carbon offers more power and more expandability than the Air, at a higher cost.\n\nProcessors and keyboards\n\nBoth the T480 and X1 Carbon have the latest Intel processors and should deliver much the same performance. Having bought a desktop with a Core i5-8400, I\u2019m pretty confident that the quad-core i5-8250U will last you five years. You don\u2019t need a Core i7-8550U for word processing, note-taking and browsing. The i7 only costs an extra \u00a391.20 in the UK, which is tempting, but perhaps you could spend the cash on a better screen.\n\nI couldn\u2019t say which machine has a better keyboard without trying them side by side. In theory, the T480 should be better, because thicker laptops allow keys with more travel. However, given the X1 Carbon\u2019s hero status as Lenovo\u2019s brand leader, I\u2019d expect it to be above average and not significantly worse.\n\nOtherwise, as I keep saying, laptop keyboards are not ergonomic. Whenever possible, put your laptop on a riser \u2013 or just a pile of books \u2013 and plug in an ergonomic USB keyboard and mouse.\n\nScreen matters\n\nMacBook screens are generally excellent while ThinkPad screens range from not so good to outstanding. If you were to buy a T480 with the 1366 x 768 TN (non-IPS) screen, you\u2019d be disappointed. The X1 Carbon screens generally seem better, and if you do a custom build, you get a choice. In the UK, the high-resolution WQHD (2560 x 1440) screen costs an extra \u00a369.60, while the top-of-the-range 2560 x 1440-pixel HDR (High Dynamic Range) screen, which looks amazing, adds \u00a3120.\n\nIf you set the brightness too high then it will also devour your battery, but that\u2019s another story.\n\nIn the end, both machines are good, but they meet different needs. It seems to me that you will benefit from the X1 Carbon\u2019s best features \u2013 lightness, fast charging and screen quality \u2013 but you will not really benefit from the T480\u2019s features, such as fat batteries and the ability to handle 32GB of RAM. In the end, of course, it\u2019s your money, your choice.\n\nHave you got a question?

He has been making a living like this on the Indian Ocean since he was 14. His father was a fisherman, too.\n\nNow in his 30s, Ibrahim says earning enough from traditional fishing is tough, but has its compensations.

Show Hide China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China \u2013 and Chinese goods \u2013 with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century \"silk road\", made up of a \"belt\" of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime \"road\" of shipping lanes. Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects? In Cities of the New Silk Road we have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project's tangible results so far \u2013 from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed \u201cGermany\u2019s China city\u201d. Our correspondents have reported from the \u201cnext Dubai\u201d rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa\u2019s largest port, and more.\n\nNick Van Mead Read more: Cities of the New Silk Road\n\n\n\nIn a decade, however, the mud-and-thatch homes of Mlingotini, and a further four villages along this coastline 30 miles north of Dar Es Salaam, will be gone \u2013 razed to make space for a $10bn Chinese-built mega-port and a special economic zone backed by an Omani sovereign wealth fund.\n\nThe area south of Bagamoyo \u2013 once notorious as a key staging point in the slave trade and unsuccessfully proposed 12 years ago as a world heritage site \u2013 is seen by China as a new Shenzhen. Before Deng Xiaoping designated Shenzhen as China\u2019s first special economic zone in 1979, it, too, was just a small fishing town. Now it is a hi-tech hub and one of the world\u2019s biggest cities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The masterplan for Bagamoyo special economic zone. Photograph: EPZA Tanzania\n\nBagamoyo, if the project goes ahead as planned, will be transformed into the largest port in Africa. That is looking ever more likely: after years of delay, the Tanzanian government says it is in the final stages of talks with state-run China Merchants Holdings International.\n\nThe lagoon will be dredged, to allow access to the vast cargo ships that will queue many miles out to sea. As for the special economic zone, the original masterplan shows factories in a fenced-off industrial area, and apartment blocks to accommodate the estimated future population of 75,000. There is even talk of an international airport. Many of the villagers have already accepted compensation for the loss of their homes.\n\nThe comparison with Shenzhen may not be so far-fetched, says the China-Africa specialist Lauren Johnston of New South Economics. \u201cWould visitors to Shenzhen in 1980 have believed what would be unlocked by that sleepy port?\u201d she says. \u201cBagamoyo could become an industrial gateway not only for youth-filled Tanzania but half a dozen landlocked African countries. There are parallels.\u201d\n\nThe proposed radical transformation of the Bagamoyo coastline is an unofficial extension to east Africa as part of Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 and is just the latest in a long line of China-in-Africa projects. Ahead of next month\u2019s China-Africa summit, foreign minister Wang Yi is inviting African leaders to \u201cget on board the fast train of development\u201d.\n\nThe Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world\n\nIt is now nine years since China overtook the US as Africa\u2019s largest trading partner. Although Kenya and Ethiopia were the only two African nations among the 30 countries signing economic and trade agreements at the Belt and Road Forum (Barf) in Beijing in May last year, China has been busy on the continent.\n\nThe flagship Belt and Road project is Kenya\u2019s 290-mile railway from the capital, Nairobi, to the port city of Mombasa, which opened to the public last year. There are plans to extend that network into South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi; it was already the country\u2019s largest infrastructure project since independence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kenyan and Chinese employees prepare to receive a train on the Nairobi to Mombasa railway, built and managed by a Chinese firm. Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, landlocked Ethiopia got a 470-mile electric railway from its capital, Addis Ababa, to the port in the neighbouring dictatorship of Djibouti. The \u00a32.5bn project \u2013 financed by a Chinese bank and built by Chinese companies \u2013 opened in January. Addis\u2019s new light rail system, too, was funded and built by China, and operated by Shenzhen Metro Group. And Djibouti, in exchange for major investments, preferential loans, a pipeline and two airports, got China\u2019s first overseas military base.\n\nWhile east Africa has been the main focus of Belt and Road on the continent, Chinese infrastructure projects stretch all the way to Angola and Nigeria, with ports planned along the coast from Dakar to Libreville and Lagos. Beijing has also signalled its support for the African Union\u2019s proposal of a pan-African high-speed rail network.\n\nWhere does China in Africa end, and Belt and Road begin? Professor Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute, says the definition is vague \u2013 but getting too caught up in that misses the point. \u201cIf you\u2019d like a project to be Belt and Road, it can be Belt and Road,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can fit anything into it. It\u2019s a way of getting support for your project.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The opening ceremony in Djibouti for China\u2019s first overseas military base. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nMao\u2019s mega-project reborn?\n\nThe new port of Bagamoyo could see the revival of what Tsang calls \u201cthe very first China in Africa mega-project\u201d: the Tazara railway line, stretching from the copper mines of Zambia to Dar Es Salaam.\n\nTazara dates back to the 1960s, when Chairman Mao Zedong won friends on the continent by supporting anti-colonial movements such as that of Julius Nyerere in Tanzania. The 1,100-mile railway opened to much fanfare in 1976 \u2013 it was the first infrastructure project conceived on a pan-African scale.\n\nFour decades later, the once-grand station in Dar Es Salaam stands empty most days, its missing ceiling panels exposing rotting beams and allowing water to pool on the floor. Two rusty trains a week rattle up and down the line. In the cavernous main hall, a few people wait under broken TV screens for an express service which is running nine hours late.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Chinese-built Tazara train station in Dar Es Salaam in 1970. Nearly half a century later the grandeur of the vast main hall is decidedly faded. Photograph: Alamy\n\nBut the old line could \u201cshine again\u201d, promised former Chinese ambassador Lu Youqing. There is a proposed extension to Bagamoyo, and a plan to link a revamped Tazara to landlocked Malawi, Rwanda, and Burundi. The railway\u2019s chief executive has talked excitedly of 125mph trains.\n\n\n\nThe key difference is that Tazara was mostly paid for by Chinese aid money \u2013 a significant investment given how impoverished China was at the time. Whether branded Belt and Road or not, virtually every new project is now funded by Chinese commercial loans.\n\nWhat is China's Belt and Road Initiative? Read more\n\nThere have been concerns about these loans. Research by the Centre for Global Development found Djibouti was among eight Belt and Road countries significantly or highly vulnerable to debt distress from the loans \u2013 with IMF figures showing its public external debt swelling from 50% to 85% of GDP in two years. Before his visit to Africa in March, former US secretary of state Rex Tillerson accused China of predatory loan practices; when she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton warned of China\u2019s \u201cnew colonialism\u201d. Four months into the job, Tillerson\u2019s successor Mike Pompeo is yet to visit.\n\n\n\nThough China loaned a whopping $95.5bn on the continent between 2000 and 2015, researchers at the China Africa Research Initiative found most of this was spent addressing Africa\u2019s infrastructure gap. Some 40% of the Chinese loans paid for power projects, and another 30% went on modernising transport infrastructure. The loans were at comparatively low interest rates and with long repayment periods.\n\n\u201cThe risk for African borrowers relates to the project\u2019s profitability,\u201d says Cari director Deborah Br\u00e4utigam. \u201cWill they be able to generate enough economic activity through these projects to repay these loans? Or are the projects seen more as ribbon-cutting opportunities? The Chinese believe that ports and special economic zones are a \u2018win-win\u2019 development tool. It\u2019s what they did at home at an earlier stage of their development.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fishermen Ibrahim Chamume and Ramadan Hamis on the beach at Mlingotini, the future site of a $10bn Chinese-built mega-port.\n\nMany African people certainly see grounds for optimism.

From the taxi drivers in the old town in their starched white kanzu cotton robes to the fashionable young restaurant manager, all were confident they would profit from more businesses, more offices, more jobs, more money. The original masterplan includes talk of schools and health centres, playgrounds and fibre-optic broadband.\n\nEven the fishermen \u2013 whose quiet lives look set to be turned upside down \u2013 seem optimistic. Despite concerns that the compensation already paid in connection with the special economic zone was not enough to relocate, most thought the new wealth would somehow trickle down. \u201cIt will bring many benefits,\u201d says Ibrahim Chamume as we shelter under a thatched roof from a tropical downpour.

Unsafe abortions leave 250,000 women in Brazil hospitalised annually and cause 200 deaths.\n\nRosa Weber, the supreme court judge who called the hearing, is steering the case through the court and has called upon dozens of doctors, government officials, specialists, campaigners, churches and religious organisations to speak on Friday and Monday.\n\nLast year, Weber dismissed a petition from a Brazilian woman, Rebecca Mendes, to terminate a pregnancy in Brazil on procedural grounds. Mendes had her abortion in Colombia.\n\nTwo days after the hearing, Argentina\u2019s senate votes on a bill to decriminalise abortion that has raised Brazilian campaigners\u2019 hopes. But there is no timeline on when the supreme court might vote on the issue, said Elo\u00edsa Machado, a professor of constitutional law at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the threats made against Diniz remain online, in comments left under her photograph \u2013 captioned \u201cyou are a monster\u201d and posted on June 23 \u2013 on the Facebook page of a group calling itself the National Union of Rightist Students. One featured a gif of a man pointing a gun. Another said she should have been aborted at birth.\n\n\n\nThree men turned up at congress when Diniz was there, saying they wanted to \u201ctalk to her\u201d and filming her. Others sent threats to her through WhatsApp. Police recommended she entered a protection programme and left her home.\n\n\u201cThey asked for a series of protective measures,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the health ministry, there are almost a million illegal terminations of pregnancy a year in Brazil. In 2016 alone, 203 women died as a result of unsafe abortions. Most at risk are black women from low-income groups, Diniz said, because richer Brazilian women can afford to pay for safer, albeit illegal, abortions.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a 35-year-old black woman in the north-eastern city of Recife told of how she aborted at home after taking Misoprostol tablets. She already had two young sons and at the time was going through a difficult separation from her husband, father to the youngest child.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was in a totally unstructured home with a young child and a father who I didn\u2019t love or respect any more,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very painful in all senses \u2013 physically, psychologically, it is a very difficult thing for a woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe has no regrets, however, and believes she made a responsible choice even though, as an evangelical Christian, she contradicted church teaching.\n\n\u201cIt is a public health issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to use empathy. There is a big lack of this in Brazil.\u201d\n\n\n\nLeila Katz, an obstetrician-gynaecologist who works in an obstetric emergency ward in Recife, deals with women suffering complications \u2013 including sepsis, haemorrhage and infections \u2013 after unsafe abortions. She said black market Misoprostol tablets reduced cases but have become scarce recently, causing a new rise in complications.\n\n\u201cThis whole problem of abortion being illegal and criminalised is very sad,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nSergio Rego, a paediatrician and researcher at government research institute Fiocruz, will tell the hearing why his wife Marisa opted for an abortion after she got pregnant soon after the birth of their son Pedro, the only survivor of triplets. Pedro, now 33, was born with multiple disabilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe already had two other children,\u201d he said. \u201cOne more at that time would have made it more difficult to take care adequately of Pedro. It was a very rational option.\u201d\n\nPedro and Marisa will be there to hear him speak.\n\n\n\nBrazil is a profoundly conservative country, with a Catholic majority and an increasing number of politically active evangelical Christians who are largely against abortion. In a poll last year, only 26% of Brazilians said women should be able to decide to interrupt a pregnancy, even though 45% said they knew someone who had had an abortion.\n\n\n\nNot all those opposing abortion at the hearing will do so on religious grounds. Hermes Nery, a professor of bioethics from the National Pro-Life and Pro-Family Association, said the move to decriminalise abortion is part of an international movement that offends Brazilian sovereignty. \u201cIt is an anti-life and anti-family agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nLast November, a congress committee approved a bill that would effectively ban abortion in all circumstances. It has yet to be voted on by both houses.\n\nThe hearing comes during a heated presidential election campaign, in which a leading campaigner, far-right army captain and lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, faces charges at the same supreme court for telling a female lawmaker in 2014 that she did not \u201cdeserve to be raped\u201d.\n\n\n\nBrazilian women braced for battle amid simmering fears over abortion | Jo Griffin Read more\n\nLeading polls, though he is currently jailed on corruption charges and unlikely to be able to run, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the former president, has long said he is personally opposed to abortion. His campaign managers said he now believes the state should \u201cdiscuss the legislation\u201d.\n\nEnvironmentalist Marina Silva, another presidential contender, believes a plebiscite should be held, while Conservative candidate Geraldo Alckmin has called the current legislation \u201cadequate\u201d. Neither Bolsonaro nor leftist candidate Ciro Gomes responded to requests for their position.\n\nBrazil\u2019s health ministry may provide one of the most powerful pro-abortion arguments at the hearing.

Here are our tips for sorting the frank from the fickle.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoughly seven million UK residents are currently using dating sites, according to a recent study of online dating services . Yet, only two thirds \u2013 66% \u2013 of online daters say they have actually gone on a date with someone they\u2019ve met through a dating site or app. So what\u2019s stopping the other third from meeting up? It could come down to the quality of conversation in the early stages of chatting online. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell how genuine someone\u2019s questions are, or how deep their interest lies. They say \u2018hi\u2019, you reply. But then it\u2019s radio silence. So you reply again, \u201cHello?\u201d, still nothing. Other times, you\u2019ve been chatting away for weeks, but pinning down a date for that first big meet proves impossible. Sound familiar? Here are some tips for sorting the frank from the fickle.\n\n1. They\u2019ve replied to your initial message\n\nIt might sound obvious, but if you\u2019ve sent a message to someone whose dating bio you like the look of, but they haven\u2019t replied, it\u2019s probably a no-go. 94 percent of online daters say they expect a response to their message within 24 hours of sending it. So if you\u2019re holding out for a response from Suzi, 36 who you messaged over a week ago, don\u2019t. She probably has her hazel eyes and quirky hair cut set on other sites. It\u2019s time to message someone else.\n\n2. Their messages include all the right signals\n\nProfessional flirting coach Gene Smith uses the acronym \u2018FLIG\u2019 to explain how you can tell if someone is flirting with you. Smith\u2019s example refers to meeting people in person, however her principles can be applied to online dating too. \u2018F\u2019 stands for frequency; how often are you chatting to this person online? \u2018L\u2019 is for length; how long are the conversations you\u2019re having with them? The \u2018I\u2019 refers to intensity \u2013 you want the conversation to have a level of intensity that you feel comfortable with. It goes without saying that you should be wary of anyone you meet online who seems overly pushy to meet up straight away. The \u2018G\u2019 is for gesture, which in Smith\u2019s example refers to body language. Here, however, you could interpret gesture as whether or not they show willing to meet up for a date.\n\n37% of couples who met online chatted for a week before going on their first date. If you find you\u2019re chatting to someone who\u2019s all questions and flirty comments, but seems hesitant to hatch a meet-up plan, it\u2019s probably time to move on.\n\n3. You plan your second date on your first\n\nIf you\u2019ve already been on a first date, and everything seemed to go well, you might be wondering how, or when, to broach the topic of date number two. You might also be surprised to learn that 77% of couples planned their second date during the first date, so our advice here is to waste no time. If you feel like you enjoyed each other\u2019s company and you can potentially see a romantic future together, suggest a second meeting. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re male or female \u2013 it\u2019s the twenty-first century; embrace your freedom to propose another date.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re reading through this article feeling like none of this advice applies to you yet, because you\u2019re currently getting nowhere whatsoever with online dating. Your experience thus far has involved sending umpteen initial messages and receiving zero replies. If this sounds familiar, it might be worth revisiting your dating profile. A recent survey conducted by Paired Life found that 55% of online daters believe the most important aspect of an online dating profile is the \u2018about me\u2019 section. So it\u2019s definitely worth putting some time into this; be authentic and make sure you give enough information about yourself and your interests.

So perhaps it\u2019s worth repeating, in full, the first paragraph of an AFP report from earlier this week:\n\nJeremy Hunt, Britain\u2019s new foreign secretary, has made an awkward debut in China when he sought to curry favour with his hosts by mentioning his Chinese wife, but accidentally referred to her as \u2018Japanese\u2019.\u201d\n\nJeremy Hunt makes 'terrible' gaffe about his wife in China Read more\n\nYour first question might well be: how? Seriously, how? And the answer is, simply: Jeremy Hunt.\n\nBecoming foreign secretary by replacing Boris Johnson \u2013 a man who thinks he is Winston Churchill but is actually Prince Philip \u2013 Hunt was supposed to make us less of a laughing stock on the world stage. He is meant to be the straight, serious man.\n\nA poll on Tuesday by ConservativeHome revealed that just 55% of Tory party members think their party can win the next election outright or in coalition, and in a separate SkyData poll, 74% of the public think Theresa May is doing a bad job. With May\u2019s position far from secure, Hunt is one of the favourites to replace her. (Johnson, unfathomably, still polls well as a replacement, despite the fact you could never be too sure he wouldn\u2019t swap his Remembrance Sunday poppy for one of those clown water-squirt flowers, just for a laugh.)\n\nBut the truth is, if Hunt is the Tories\u2019 best hope for aptitude and gravitas, they are in trouble. He has quite the history of gaffes, quirks and snafus. On Tuesday afternoon, as a social media mea culpa for wifegate, Hunt tweeted: \u201cIn Paris, choosing some flowers to bring back to Mrs H\u201d. Might I suggest sakura, the national flower of Japan? But also, what\u2019s with \u201cMrs H?\u201d This is neither an affair during the 19th century, nor Mumsnet.\n\nJeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) In Paris choosing some flowers to bring back to Mrs H pic.twitter.com/iGzWyj0oOA\n\nHunt has brought Mrs H, or Lucia Guo, as she is actually known, into the public eye once before. In fairness, that time he gets full points for getting her nationality correct, saying: \u201cMy wife is Chinese \u2026 are we going to be a country that is prepared to work hard in the way that Asian economies are prepared to work hard?\u201d Which rather pissed off people in the UK. He didn\u2019t piss people off quite as much as Labour\u2019s Helen Goodman, however, whose response was: \u201cIf China is so great, why did Jeremy Hunt\u2019s wife come to England?\u201d That\u2019s the thing about politics: put your foot in your mouth, and you can guarantee it won\u2019t be too long before someone stuffs an entire leg into theirs.\n\nOther Hunt classics include: when he accidentally pulled the emergency stop cord in a train loo; the time he posed for a photo in front of an entire whiteboard of confidential patient records, which he then tweeted; and that glorious moment when he almost decapitated a woman when ringing a bell.\n\nHe was also once: followed around a car park, in the rain, by a sousaphone player (thanks to television show, The Last Leg); followed again by a giant sousaphone player while crossing a road (The Last Leg again); presented with a giant, gold penis for being \u201cDick of the Year\u201d (you spoil us, The Last Leg!); and was given an 8ft mock-up of a \u201cstatistics for dummies\u201d book by a group of junior doctors. Oh, there\u2019s also the time he bizarrely would only be interviewed standing up on Newsnight, which prompted presenter James O\u2019Brien to comment afterwards, deadpan: \u201cI should explain it was not my idea to conduct that interview both standing up: it was Mr. Hunt\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the time Hunt oversaw the installation of a \u00a344,000 bathroom suite, but then, who among us has not gone a bit Versailles with the renovations? Hunt did clarify that the bathroom was a communal one. Presumably so others could help him differentiate between a flush chain and an emergency cord.\n\nHe\u2019s a strange one, is Hunt. Apart from undermining an entire generation of NHS staff, pretty much ignoring what the Red Cross deemed a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in our hospitals, and spending his Saturdays with a megaphone shouting: \u201cWHY AREN\u2019T YOU AT WORK?\u201d into the faces of passersby \u2013 probably \u2013 he has sometimes come across as smart and, when not squirrelling out the back entrance of Richmond House to avoid protesters, pretty affable. Despite this, he\u2019s still been followed around twice by a sousaphone player.\n\nIt\u2019s just not really the quality one looks for in a leader, is it? At the very least you want someone who is competent and respected. You don\u2019t want the guy who, as culture secretary, should have been seriously scrutinising the Murdochs\u2019 takeover bid for BSkyB instead of dancing the lambada \u2013 an actual, genuine hobby of Hunt\u2019s for which he has a specially dedicated sprung room in his home, as revealed by Michael Gove (\u201cDance your stubborn best!\u201d). By all accounts, by which I mean specifically the account that Hunt\u2019s dance teacher once gave in an interview, the foreign secretary is very good. The Times calls him the \u201clambada king\u201d. He even used to attend salsa classes at Pineapple Dance Studios, which puts him in the same category as a lot of early noughties reality television stars. Unclear whether he, too, used to wear a pastel-coloured velour tracksuit.\n\nI genuinely think it\u2019s refreshing for politicians to have a passion, but how can one trust that Hunt has even remembered his passion correctly? He might turn around tomorrow and remember it\u2019s actually the tango he loves. And what to do with a guy who, when the Conservatives decided to zhoosh up their Instagram page for conference, could only contribute by sitting slightly obscured behind a door with a nervous grin? Don\u2019t worry, Kendall Jenner!\n\nJeremy Hunt on Brexit: 'We are heading for no deal by accident' Read more\n\nIt\u2019s true, he has staying power. He became the longest-serving health secretary \u2013 although smugly tweeting the Twainesque \u201creports of my death have been greatly exaggerated\u201d after clinging to his job when people were dying in hospital corridors, did not, I would suggest, strike the right tone. He has cannily positioned himself as a unity candidate, voting for remain, but now suggesting he would vote leave in a second referendum.\n\nBut if Hunt, whose general appearance is of a vampire who\u2019s just walked in on his own surprise birthday party, is the best the Tories have got, it just highlights the true farce that is the rest of government. Brexit means Brexit, even though nobody knows what Brexit means, and so nobody knows what means means; and the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg seem intent on destroying all future prosperity and causing havoc in Northern Ireland. I suppose the one good thing about the prime minister, who read geography at university (be honest, you knew that even if you didn\u2019t), is, well, she probably knows the difference between China and Japan.\n\n\u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist", "sentiment": 0.10192954545454547, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "So Jeremy Hunt is the Tories' capable one?

One journalist described the institution as \u201cthe worst place in Sarajevo apart from the morgue\u201d.\n\nIt is more than 20 years since I first arrived in Sarajevo in late summer 1996. The destruction in the city was jaw-dropping: rows and rows of broken, bombed-out high-rise flats, shell craters and explosion indents everywhere; libraries, offices, factories all in ruins. This was city-wide destruction \u2013 a late-20th-century Dresden or Stalingrad.\n\nThe Bosnian war had ended in 1995 and Sarajevo was enjoying its long-awaited peace. Sarajevans took to its scarred streets in huge numbers, eating ice cream and drinking coffee safe in the knowledge they wouldn\u2019t be struck down by a sniper or shell. It was a time for simple pleasures. Anxieties about the future, unemployment, PTSD and rebuilding their city would come later.\n\nSunday outing, Sarajevo, 1998. Photo by Edina Hrnjic aged 14.\n\n\n\nIn 1997 I set up a darkroom using donated equipment from Scotland and started a small photo class in the basement of the orphanage.\n\n\n\nI taught the children, aged six to 16, basic photography techniques \u2013 shooting with 35mm SLR film cameras, developing their films and printing. There were no themed assignments or teaching of preconceived notions of what photography was, and the language barrier would not allow for the teaching of technicalities.\n\nIt was intended to be a creative outlet for children who had experienced an intense period of trauma during the war. But equally it had to be easy, it had to be fun Chris Leslie\n\nThe children from the orphanage and surrounding neighbourhood ran around their playgrounds and streets documenting anything that came into their viewpoint. They had free rein to photograph what they saw and what they wanted to capture. They photographed friends, strangers, destruction, peace-keeping soldiers, old ladies nosing out of windows, dogs in the park, street scenes, shopkeepers.\n\nI ran the project voluntarily for three consecutive summers before training up one of the local students, Edina Hrnjic, to take over and run the project for the younger children.\n\nMost of the photographs taken by these young people lay forgotten as negatives for more than 20 years and have only now been developed and scanned. The photographs show an honest and unique perspective on a Sarajevo that no longer exists. Its war-scarred buildings have been repaired and huge shopping malls and skyscraper apartments now fill the skyline.\n\nDina Dz\u030cihanic\u0301 in Sarajevo in June 2018, photo by Chris Leslie.

When the photo project was set up, she saw it as something special that she was lucky to be involved in. As a young child, she says, her experiences of war had been better than those of peace.\n\n\u201cWar was the norm and everyone was equal: no one had anything,\u201d she says. \u201cBut after war as people returned they had nice clothes, nice school stuff. The years after the war we really struggled \u2013 we had to wear old clothes that were too small for us. These were the worst moments for me.\u201d\n\nI remember the full darkroom process, even today. I was not aware that the photographs could be made by our hands.

In 1993 war made life impossible, and he ran away to the besieged city of Sarajevo.\n\nHe entered a children\u2019s institution there and stayed until 2004, when he was told to leave. A few years later he won a place to study documentary film and TV at the University of Wales and came to the UK on a student visa. He graduated with honours and set up his own successful film and video production agency in Cambridge.\n\nI was one of the first students to join the photography project.

Instead it decided to let her go quietly months later, possibly to contain the potential embarrassment it could cause.\n\nAn intelligence source told the Guardian the woman was dismissed last summer after the state department revoked her security clearance. It came shortly before a round of expulsions of US personnel demanded by the Kremlin after Washington imposed more sanctions on the country.\n\nThe order to remove more than 750 US personnel from its 1,200-strong diplomatic mission is understood to have provided cover for her removal.\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service is trying to hide the breach by firing [her],\u201d the source said. \u201cThe damage was already done but the senior management of the Secret Service did not conduct any internal investigation to assess the damage and to see if [she] recruited any other employees to provide her more information.\n\n\u201cOnly an intense investigation by an outside source can determine the damage she has done.\u201d\n\nAsked detailed questions about the investigation into the woman, and her dismissal, the Secret Service attempted to downplay the significance of her role. But it did not deny that she had been identified as a potential mole.\n\nIn a statement, it said: \u201cThe US Secret Service recognizes that all Foreign Service Nationals (FSN) who provide services in furtherance of our mission, administrative or otherwise, can be subjected to foreign intelligence influence.\n\n\u201cThis is of particular emphasis in Russia. As such, all foreign service nationals are managed accordingly to ensure that Secret Service and United States government interests are protected at all times.

She did not respond to numerous email requests to discuss her role at the embassy or the allegations made against her.\n\nIt is understood she came under suspicion two years ago during a routine review of Secret Service personnel in the so-called Paris district of the agency, which includes Moscow, London and Frankfurt. The RSO reviews take place every five years.\n\nWith a role that gave her an insight into ongoing Secret Service investigations, the woman had access to the US Secret Service intranet, its internal email, and its counterfeit money tracking system.\n\nA source claimed \u201cher frequent contacts with the FSB gave her away ... numerous unsanctioned meetings and communications\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian has been told the state department\u2019s resident agents in charge alerted the Secret Service in January 2017 and at least nine high-ranking Secret Service officials became aware of the findings.\n\nAt the time, separate CIA and FBI inquires were also under way, but it appears the Secret Service was expected to take the lead. It failed to do so, according to a source.\n\n\u201cShe had access to the most damaging database, which is the US Secret Service official mail system,\u201d the source said. \u201cPart of her access was schedules of the president \u2013 current and past \u2013 vice-president, and their spouses, including Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nShe had plenty of time to gather intelligence without supervision, the source said. \u201cSeveral employees interacted with her on a personal level by emailing her personally on a non-work account. This isn\u2019t allowed.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was apparently notified about the case but it is unclear how much detail was passed on to officials outside the agency. It is also unclear why the woman, a Russian national, was hired by the Secret Service in the first place or what kind of vetting took place.\n\nThe Guardian has been told that the potential breach was not reported to any of the congressional intelligence or oversight committees.\n\nA source said: \u201cA government committee needs to investigate the Secret Service for hiding this breach.\u201d\n\nAnother option would be to include it in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into suspected Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe US Congress is focusing on Russian hackers when it is possible that all of the information they needed to get into the system came from the internal breach in the Secret Service,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cHer activities of stealing and sharing information could shed more light on how the Russians were able to hack the 2016 presidential election office of the DNC [Democratic National Committee].\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cI think that the special counsel would be the perfect outside entity to investigate the level of damage that [she] caused.

After four years it seems the India captain has grown sick of being asked about it. But he did open up on it once, in 2015. \u201cI put too much pressure on myself,\u201d he said in an interview with Cricket Monthly. \u201cI made it seem like a big mountain in front of me and once I was not able to scale it I was really disappointed.\u201d\n\nVirat Kohli\u2019s brilliant century frustrates England in India fightback Read more\n\nKohli arrived back in those same foothills just after midday on Thursday, his team reeling after two quick wickets, and set himself for another attempt on the far summit, five Tests distant at the other end of the English summer.\n\nBy stumps Kohli was that much closer to the top. He had hauled his team up with him, almost single-handedly, to within 13 runs of England\u2019s first-innings score. It had been a hard, bloody struggle but he had made his first Test 50, then his first Test century, in England. And he had done it despite the best efforts of the 36-year-old Jimmy Anderson, who bowled 22 overs, three more than anyone else and more than twice as many as Stuart Broad. Over half of them were to Kohli alone, in a duel between the world\u2019s best Test batsman and bowler.\n\nAnderson was already on when Kohli came in, seven overs deep into his spell from the City End. He must have been tiring but he, too, set himself to come again and their contest was renewed. Nobody has taken Kohli\u2019s wicket in Test cricket more often than Anderson. Four years ago Anderson got him four times in five matches. But Kohli is a different batsman now, better, more resourceful and self-assured. He immediately took guard outside his crease, a technique he developed specifically to deal with Anderson\u2019s type of bowling after he failed against it on the previous tour here.\n\nAnderson bowled 74 balls to Kohli, who made \u200bonly 18 runs off them. The other 131 Kohli scored came in the 151 deliveries he faced from everyone else\n\nThe idea was to counteract Anderson\u2019s swing through the air by meeting the ball early and to force Anderson to drag his length back. Kohli has said his problem in 2014 was that he was so worried about the inswinger that he ended up out of position for the one that went away. Here Anderson showed him that same worrisome inswinger early on, with his very third ball, to plant a seed of doubt in Kohli\u2019s mind. It worked. Kohli seemed hesitant, unsure, and soon after he threw a loose drive that edged the ball down low to Jos Buttler\u2019s left at gully.\n\nTwice more Kohli edged the ball just short of England\u2019s close fielders. And then he shaped to break for a quick single but scurried back when he saw Joe Root closing in on the ball. The match flowed around him. At the other end India\u2019s middle order was swept away by Sam Curran and then Ben Stokes. Kohli, locked into this combat with Anderson, was too busy trying to survive to help. Anderson bowled, almost unchanged, for three more overs before lunch and five after it. He took one brief spell, reprieved by Adil Rashid for a single over before the break.\n\nSam Curran praises Virat Kohli\u2019s century as England regret dropped catches Read more\n\nThen, when Kohli was on 21, he erred again \u2013 another edge. This one carried thigh-high to Dawid Malan at second slip, who dropped it. Anderson had worked and waited eight long overs for that moment. Now it had passed. Root finally decided to pull him out of the attack. He was not off long. Root brought him back on right after tea, when Kohli was on 53. In the second over of this spell Anderson was sure he had his man again, lbw with another inswinger. The umpire Chris Gaffney disagreed, and rightly too, because when England called for a review it showed the ball was missing leg stump.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nAnderson was bowling as well as ever, and beat both Ravi Ashwin and Mohammed Shami, but Kohli was just beginning to get his measure. Altogether Anderson bowled 74 balls to Kohli, who made only 18 runs off them, 12 of them in 31 balls during this second spell after tea.\n\nThe other 131 he scored came in the 151 deliveries Kohli faced from everyone else. The crowd had booed Kohli when he came out. When he walked off again, they gave him an ovation.

The scene was chaotic. \u201cNos cay\u00f3 la tormenta,\u201d one worker told me: the storm descended on us.\n\nOne minute, people were slapping labels on packages of bacon. The next, there were uniformed men shouting, \u201cGo!\u201d Many workers thought the building was on fire. They fled outside to handcuffs and the swirling lights of police cars. Three men hid in a storeroom, crouched on stacks of wooden pallets. They waited it out and escaped.

Pregnant women and women with small children were also released, a mercy bestowed only because of timing: earlier in June, after a large raid on an Ohio gardening center, hundreds of children had been stranded at daycare centers and schools when their parents were detained. The situation had caused public outcry, which Ice was keen to avoid this time around.\n\nMany of the released women were given ankle bracelets and court dates; others were told to watch for papers in the mail. Meanwhile, the women held in detention disappeared. While the detained men were channeled to Youngstown and Cleveland and Michigan and began to strategize with family members via phone, the women vanished; more than a week after the raid, no one had any idea where they were.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) special agents arrested alleged immigration violators at Fresh Mark, Salem on 19 June 2018. Photograph: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\n\nIn response, the labeling line at Fresh Mark sped up. The remaining workers had to compensate for missing bodies. Sandra, a Guatemalan mother of three who\u2019d been detained in the raid and released because she was eight months pregnant, explained to me: \u201cLos Americanos se van.\u201d The Americans leave. The work is too much for them, the line too fast, she said, with the only hint of pride I saw light up her face. There were too few workers left: seven out of 11 in Sandra\u2019s unit had been detained. The four who remained were viejitas, Sandra explained: little old ladies.\n\nFresh Mark produces meat products: the hot dogs sold at baseball stadiums across the midwest, the pepperoni on pizza, the bacon on Wendy\u2019s Baconator. These iconic American products \u2013 bought at Walmart and grilled in a backyard on the Fourth of July, sizzled up for Sunday breakfast, chowed in the seventh inning of a Reds game \u2013 are carefully prepared by indigenous Guatemalans working long hours without papers.\n\nThe landing page on the Fresh Mark website is a banner of a little white boy taking a piece of bacon from a paper-towel covered plate, held out by an older white hand. The banner reads: \u201cFeeding families is a great responsibility.\u201d In the lower right corner is a circular stamp declaring: \u201cMade With Pride, USA, Since 1920.\u201d The Made in USA stamp travels with the scroll, standing firm in the right corner.\n\nScrolling down, the company announces over a supersized image of pepperoni pizza: \u201cLike you, we take it very seriously. Some of the world\u2019s most well-known grocery stores, food service companies and restaurants count on Fresh Mark.\u201d\n\nScrolling a little further, the message concludes on a photo of a blonde, white girl eating a sandwich: \u201cSo our customers and yours,\u201d the banner reads, \u201ccan focus on what really matters.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe Friday after the raid, I traveled to Salem with my friend Mary Jayne, who runs a non-profit that offers interpreting and translation services, to volunteer as an interpreter for released detainees and family members of the detained.\n\nApproaching Salem from the south-east, we drove on a narrow seam between plots of corn and soybean. Passing through the small communities of Unity and Columbiana, the American flags came on quick and brash: 15, 20, 50 in rapid succession, until the excess was almost comical. Then, quick as they\u2019d appeared, the flags were gone, and we were back in open land and sky.\n\nSoon, we arrived at the Centro San Pablo, a charitable organization run out of the packed, overheated basement of Salem\u2019s Saint Paul\u2019s Catholic church.\n\nCentro San Pablo is run by Sister Rene Weeks, a tall, thin white woman with close-cropped gray hair who manages to be everywhere and handling everything at once. She welcomed us before disappearing into the fray.\n\nTwo lawyers sat at a folding table with laptops and papers. The wait to see them was hours long. Women breastfed infants in slings, and many wore outfits that were Walmart incantations of indigenous Guatemalan dress: ankle-length skirts with floral prints, black flats with fake rhinestones. Several girls had combs in their long black hair, which fell to their waists. The men wore baseball caps, sleeveless tank tops and chanclas, open-toed athletic sandals. Most people were considerably shorter than my own 5ft 3in.\n\n'Pray for my children,' she begged us, sobbing. 'Que van a hacer mis ni\u00f1os?' Flor, in Salem\n\nThe room held that distinctly Latin American energy derived from a whole lot of people waiting interminably for an obscure bureaucratic procedure that may never come to pass. There was an open box of sticky Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Stale coffee. Packages and packages of diapers. We joined the chaos.\n\nFor the next three hours, we asked people for their names and immigration histories: were you detained? Was a family member detained? Have you heard from him or her? Did you sign anything? Have you ever been arrested, deported, had any interaction with the law?\n\nI snuck in extra questions on the side. I spent years living in Mexico, and my husband is from a tiny village that, 30 years ago, was much like the ones these people had fled. He and I have traveled throughout the remote mountain pueblos of Oaxaca, reporting on immigration, and in these Guatemalan workers\u2019 faces I remembered those mountains \u2013 the smoke coming off comales, the se\u00f1oras hurrying small children wrapped in fleece blankets through vast, empty plazas.\n\n\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d I asked one woman, whose name I carefully sounded out after she told me with shamed apology that she could not read or write. Her face was marked by the pale splotches that signify malnutrition. Like many of these migrants, her first language was K\u2019iche\u2019, and her Spanish was basic. She squinted to understand me and I leaned closer to understand her. There wasn\u2019t enough food for her and her son in Guatemala, she said. \u201cWe were searching for herbs.\u201d When I pressed further, she shook her head, closed her eyes. \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want to talk about that time.\u201d\n\nShe had come to the US with her brother, who was now in detention somewhere in the Midwest. She hadn\u2019t heard from him since Tuesday. What could she do? she asked. I had no idea. \u201cGracias,\u201d she said, and sat back to wait her turn.\n\nOne intake form after another: detained brother, uncle, husband, wife. Can I go back to work? the room wondered collectively in a dozen variations. Even those with work permits were hesitant; one 18-year-old waited hours just to sit with a lawyer and ask him if it was OK to go back.\n\n\u201cYou have a work permit!\u201d the lawyer told him. \u201cYes, yes!\u201d\n\nAround 5 o\u2019clock, Sister Rene announced that we were done for the day. She asked for a closing prayer from a woman named Flor, who was a full foot shorter than me, with dark hair pulled back in a low ponytail. Flor had been detained in the raid but released. She had five children, including a six-month-old and a one-and-a-half-year-old. She stood in the middle of the room and smiled at us. Then she bowed her head and closed her eyes, thanking the sister and the volunteers, speaking to God with the notes of humility, endurance and misericordia that form the chorus of the migrant experience. When she opened her eyes, she began to cry.\n\n\u201cPray for my children,\u201d she begged us, sobbing. \u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 van a hacer mis ni\u00f1os?\u201d\n\nFlor\n\nThe next morning, Mary Jayne and I returned to the Centro San Pablo with another volunteer interpreter from El Salvador named Ximena. At 9am, families were already waiting to apply for assistance. Their breadwinners snatched, these families were suspended over a financial cliff. My day would be spent cataloguing need. \u201cHow much food do you have in your fridge right now?\u201d \u201cHow much for rent?\u201d \u201cWhen is it due?\u201d \u201cTienes biles?\u201d\n\nMost people who weren\u2019t part of a large family lived with at least three or four others. Most did not know their landlord\u2019s name, or the name of their electric, light or gas companies. Someone showed up on their doorstep once a month and they handed that person an envelope of cash. On time, no questions.\n\nI had brought a bag of toys, and the second I put them on the ground they were descended upon by a small girl and boy. I gauged the boy\u2019s age as about two, the girl perhaps four: she was the same height as my daughter. Their mother sat near them on a chair, shushing a tiny baby in a sling. She looked unbelievably young.\n\nI am not a criminal. I\u2019m fighting to eat, to give something to my children. I\u2019m not stealing. Flor, in Salem\n\nI beckoned her to come over: \u201cPase.\u201d She spoke hardly any Spanish, only K\u2019iche\u2019. She smiled a lot. Her baby was barely three weeks old, and sick. Her little girl, whom I had thought was four, was seven. The boy was two. The husband had a job at a rancho, picking fruit or vegetables, but something had happened; I couldn\u2019t make out specifics. Neither of them had been working at Fresh Mark but had noticed a fervor of help at this moment and positioned themselves near it.\n\nShe did not know her address or her phone number and I couldn\u2019t fill out her form. I offered to help carry diapers and wipes to her house so that her husband could give me this information and the Centro could contact them later.\n\nWe set out across the hot parking lot. The mother walked quickly and the children kept up. The family crossed the streets diagonally, as if they were not streets at all but fields. Each time, I clutched the older daughter\u2019s hand. The houses had chain link fences cordoning off tiny yards, soggy toys toppled in patches of grass.\n\nAt the house, her husband was surprised and cordial, with a mouth full of gold teeth. He, too, looked impossibly young, barely into his early twenties. He spoke Spanish and explained that he\u2019d been working at a rancho \u2013 a farm or gardening center \u2013 picking tomatoes, but the work was sporadic, and lately he hadn\u2019t had enough. He was too scared now to try Fresh Mark. He was looking for more work at ranchos, but two huge raids in the preceding weeks made this dicey. He gave me his address and phone number while I watched the seven-year-old carefully remove the two-year-old\u2019s shoes.\n\nThe kitchen was small and smelled of cooking oil; next to it was a living room of the same size, bare except for scattered objects around its edges, with a linoleum floor. I couldn\u2019t see any other rooms, or furniture. The husband thanked me and I waved goodbye, the mother smiling the same smile \u2013 innocent or weary, I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nFlor, who\u2019d led the prayer on my first afternoon in Salem, told me: \u201cWe ran away from one thing in Guatemala, and now another thing is happening to us.\u201d Everywhere these migrants went, they worked \u2013 the most difficult and least appreciated work \u2013 and everywhere they went they were loathed for it.\n\nWhen Flor was detained, and she waited for hours panicking about whether she\u2019d ever see her children again, she thought, I am not a criminal. I\u2019m fighting to eat, to give something to my children. I\u2019m not stealing.\n\nWhen the national conversation tends to revolve only around the \u201cillegality\u201d of immigrants \u2013 the role of various agencies in immigration enforcement, what that enforcement should look like and how much it should cost, and most of all, whether or not to give \u201camnesty\u201d \u2013 no one actually has to acknowledge their labor.\n\nAmnesty is the most ironic term of all: Republicans rage and Democrats cower at the idea of granting \u201cforgiveness\u201d to the people who have, for decades, been powering the US economy. Here the absurdity of their invisible labor reaches its nadir: when we, driving on roads they have built, offering our toddlers the blueberries they have plucked, eating the meat they have slaughtered and cleaned and processed, ask: \u201cShould we or should we not pardon them for their work?\u201d\n\nSandra, Francisco and Isabel\n\nA week later, my husband and I returned to Salem to talk to families affected by the raid and try to get a bigger picture of its effects. The Centro San Pablo was quiet. The detained were still gone \u2013 perhaps for years. The released were lying low, trying to decide whether to return to work or pack up and head elsewhere. Several families had already left for Alabama, where there was work in the chicken plants.\n\nIn the mid-afternoon, a family wandered in. The father, Francisco, was tall and broad-chested. The mother, Sandra, was short with a big gap-toothed smile. (Sandra and Francisco, as well as their children, are identified by pseudonyms.) Sandra was noticeably pregnant and trailing three little girls. They knew most of the small smattering of people in the room and said their holas and como est\u00e1s before settling in.\n\nSandra was waiting to see what would happen after her release, whether she\u2019d get papers in the mail. Francisco, who had finished his shift at Fresh Mark just before the raid, was trying to decide if and when to go back to work.\n\nThey had both grown up near the Guatemalan border with Mexico. When she was a baby, Sandra\u2019s parents and grandparents had fled with her to the southern Mexican state of Chiapas to escape the massacre of indigenous peoples by Guatemalan government forces during a devastating civil war. When Sandra was six, her father died, and her mother remarried and started another family. Sandra\u2019s grandparents moved back to Guatemala, taking her with them. She stopped school before second grade, and began work at age seven, harvesting plums, peanuts, hibiscus. \u201cTrabajas por ti mismo,\u201d she told me: you work for yourself.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Migrants use a makeshift raft to cross the Suchiate river, natural border between Mexico and Guatemala, in Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas state, Mexico. Photograph: Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt 14, Sandra\u2019s grandfather died, and her uncle took her in, but not for free. He was a sharecropper in Chiapas. He would take her and other workers in the back of a truck across the Mexican border to his plots of land, where they would shuck and degrain corn all day. She wasn\u2019t paid. She was simply earning her keep. At 18, she decided to join Francisco, whom she\u2019d met in the village, in San Diego.\n\nShe walked for four days through the desert. Towards the end, her group ran out of water. They used their hands to scrape the needles from cactus leaves and crack them open. The water inside was so sour it was hardly drinkable, but it kept them alive.\n\nIn San Diego, she and Francisco rented a room for $550. The room was in an apartment with four other rooms, each filled with three men splitting the rent. She bought a small refrigerator and the landlord charged her $25 extra per month for it. She took care of a little boy, and Francisco worked in landscaping, but the money was barely enough. When an uncle told her about rents in Salem \u2013 where, for around the same price, Sandra and Francisco could rent a whole house and their family could live alone \u2013 they decided to make the move.\n\nFrancisco had already been in the US for 14 years. He had also started work in Guatemala at seven. In the morning, he would go to school, and in the afternoon his family would assign him a plot of land to work. He was not allowed to rest or do homework until finished, at which point it was dark. \u201cI used to study by candlelight,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had been deported twice. The first was not long after he arrived; he and four friends had the extraordinary bad luck of taking a wrong turn onto a military base. He had no idea at the time that he could avoid deportation because he was a minor. He told the authorities he was Mexican, so they sent him to Tijuana, where he crossed immediately back into the US.\n\nThe second time, he and Sandra were in Salem and the three girls had been born. He was driving in the snow and the car lost traction and slid up onto a sidewalk, where it was stranded. The police officer who came to help asked him for his license, and that was that. In detention, he said to the Ice officer: \u201cI have my daughters,\u201d and the officer replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to call them.\u201d\n\nTelling me this, he sighed. He crossed his arms over his chest. I asked him if he wanted to stay in the US.\n\n\u201cShe wants to stay here for the girls\u2019 education,\u201d he said, gesturing at Sandra.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to go back to the pueblo?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cS\u00ed, claro, s\u00ed, el pueblo,\u201d he replied, like it was a no-brainer. When I asked him what they would do in Guatemala if they went back, he widened his eyes, pursed his lips and shrugged. It was absurd. It was like asking my daughter what she would do with a million dollars: an unimaginable concept. There was no work. He might, if he were scrappy, be able to run a small subsistence farm that would feed his family. But schools? And where he lived near the Mexican border, he said, narcos were constantly killing each other.\n\nWe were interrupted by a waitress from Jalisco\u2019s, a nearby Mexican restaurant that had provided free meals for the workers affected by the raid. The waitress, Isabel, was dressed in a teal uniform straight out of a telenovela. She had a pale, heart-shaped face and a sturdy sense of conviction.\n\nIn Guatemala, Isabel said, the people don\u2019t even have potable water. They live in cardboard houses with tin roofs. There is no money for anything, not even clothes. She pointed to a certificate on the wall, thanking Jalisco\u2019s for contributing funds for a town\u2019s school. The mayor of that town, she told us, had spent money on that certificate for Jalisco\u2019s when the kids at the school didn\u2019t even have notebooks.\n\n\u201cAmericans have not seen the poverty [Guatemalans] live in,\u201d Isabel said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even earn three dollars a day. Three dollars: how much is that?\u201d She was leaning over one of the low tables. \u201cThe children are malnourished. They eat once a day. Their teeth \u2026\u201d\n\nFrancisco nodded. Sandra was on the floor, putting together a butterfly puzzle with Jorge and the girls.\n\n\u201cI lived in rough poverty. I know what it is to live through hard times, to get by day to day.\u201d Isabel had come to the US at 25 and started working in a restaurant. There were weeks, she said, when she had nothing to eat; weeks she slept as much as possible, so she didn\u2019t feel hungry. Eventually, her sisters had joined her here and they\u2019d opened Jalisco\u2019s. She\u2019d married an American citizen. They had two children.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she told us, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to raise a child who thinks they\u2019re better.\u201d She tried to guard against it, telling her kids, constantly: t\u00fa tienes todo. You have everything\n\nAshley, Tiffany, and Kelly\n\nSandra and Francisco gave their three girls American names.: Ashley, Tiffany and Kelly.\n\nThe night Sandra was detained, she called Francisco, crying, saying: \u201cTake care of my children.\u201d He was sick with fear. He did not tell the children that their mother might be sent back to a country they did not know. But they picked up on it anyway. On TV, they saw police cars with flashing lights outside their mom\u2019s workplace. The oldest asked why her mother wasn\u2019t home, what was going on. Now, when they see a police car passing, they run inside and hide.\n\n\n\nSandra and Francisco work six days a week: he on the am shift, from 6 to 2.30, she on the pm shift, from 3.30 to midnight. He walked to work at 5am so he wouldn\u2019t have to drive. I asked what they did on the weekends and they looked at me for a moment as if trying to grasp the question. The one day they had off \u2013 Sunday \u2013 they woke, cleaned the house, went to Walmart to buy groceries, then headed to the lavander\u00eda to do laundry.\n\nThat was it. That was their American life.\n\nAmericans consume their labor, literally \u2013 in protein \u2013 and figuratively, in the ongoing enthrall to corporate profit. Yet a significant percentage of Americans want to give absolutely nothing in return. Not a fair minimum wage. Not health care. Not decent education in public schools. Not even the most fundamental right of legality.\n\nAt a candlelight vigil for separated immigrant families in DC, a Sikh priest repeated: \u201cWe are not separate. We are not separate. We are not separate.\u201d Greed grows out of separateness, out of a belief that I am more deserving of the luxury of comfort, of security, of my house full of light and books than the African who has crossed an ocean and a continent to get here, than the Honduran man who picked my cherries.\n\nFlor told me that while she was waiting in detention, she couldn\u2019t eat, she couldn\u2019t drink. She had no idea if she would see her children again. She had spent $15,000 to get her family here, to this tiny town in Ohio, where there was a job on the line. All she wanted was to work and be with her children.\n\nI want to give them the best,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou know?\u201d", "sentiment": -0.025772340425531913, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "What happens after Ice tears your family apart: 'The storm descended'"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/02/is-compassion-fatigue-inevitable-in-an-age-of-24-hour-news", "text": "In April this year, a woman calling herself Apathetic Idealist wrote to an advice columnist at the New York Times, asking for help in overcoming a sense of political paralysis. This condition, which was keeping her from engaging in \u201creal action\u201d, began in November 2016, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. \u201cI continue to be outraged by this administration\u2019s treatment of Latinos, Native Americans, Muslims, LGBT folks, women and so many others,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I\u2019m struggling to summon a response.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that many people can relate to your letter. I can relate to it,\u201d began the response from the columnist, Roxane Gay. \u201cIt is damn hard to expand the limits of our empathy when our emotional attention is already stretched too thin.\u201d\n\nThis seems to be an increasingly common condition. Glance at Twitter or Facebook, and you\u2019ll probably see someone say, \u201cI\u2019m so tired\u201d. There is so much bad news that it feels like we\u2019re running out of emotions. I can relate to Apathetic Idealist, too. For the past several months, I have experienced a creeping psychic exhaustion. \u201cI\u2019m in a numb period,\u201d I tell my friends when they send me frantic texts about the day\u2019s events or ask me how I\u2019m holding up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. In the months after Trump\u2019s election, my husband, John, printed out the phone numbers of our government representatives in Colorado, where we live, and stuck them on the fridge. We started calling them weekly, demanding, even begging them to fight on our behalf \u2013 to defend the Americans with Disabilities Act, to fight the attacks on minorities and immigrants and trans people, to fight for gun control. They were supposed to be working for us, weren\u2019t they? My heart would beat faster as I made these calls, trying to translate my anger and fear into something coherent.\n\nSometimes the public outcry seemed to work. A rushed Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a flawed but important step toward universal healthcare, established under Barack Obama \u2013 failed to find support. It felt like a victory. But a few months later, those same senators cut billions from government healthcare programmes under the guise of \u201ctax reform\u201d. I made a number of calls to my representatives about the tax plan, but it didn\u2019t help; this time, the Republicans in Congress had enough votes to pass their plan into law.\n\nI haven\u2019t called my senators in months. It was starting to feel like a waste of time and energy. On most occasions, our Republican senator\u2019s office doesn\u2019t even answer the phone. Most of the time, outrage itself feels largely useless. Stay mad, social media activists like to say. How hard is it to stay mad, I remember thinking last year \u2013 just watch 20 seconds of any news clip. But it did, in fact, get hard to stay mad. The news is still horrifying, at home and around the world; I know this intellectually, but the physical feeling of horror is gone.\n\nThere\u2019s a clinical name for what Apathetic Idealist and many of us are feeling: it\u2019s called compassion fatigue. Psychologist Charles Figley defines compassion fatigue as \u201ca state of exhaustion and dysfunction, biologically, physiologically and emotionally, as a result of prolonged exposure to compassion stress\u201d. Symptoms include behavioural changes (becoming easily startled, a reduced ability to remain objective), physical changes (exhaustion, anxiety and cardiac symptoms) and emotional changes (numbness, depression, \u201cdecreased sense of purpose\u201d). It is an important framework in professions such as nursing, where over-exposure to trauma can lead to health problems for the nurses and worsened outcomes for patients. But it can and has been applied to the general population, too, especially when we are saturated with pleas for attention.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump signing an executive order on healthcare.

As historian Samuel Moyn recently put it: \u201cCompassion fatigue is as old as compassion.\u201d And the anxieties that come with our awareness of compassion fatigue go back just as far. According to Moyn, the 18th-century philosophers and moralists who \u201crooted ethics in sentiment and sympathy\u201d were simultaneously troubled that \u201cdevoting oneself to an ethic of exposure and sensitivity to others\u2019 suffering (or of engagement and action to relieve it) might lead to a numbed ethical sense\u201d. It was partly this worry that emotional fatigue could undermine our morals that led Immanuel Kant to abandon sentimentalism for an ethics based in reason \u2013 a more objective alternative, at least in theory.\n\nThe debate around the value of compassion has continued into the 21st century. There are those who argue, following Kant, that a subjective experience of empathy should not be required for moral action, and those who go further, contending that empathy actually gets in the way of morality. But the more commonly held view today seems to be that empathy is vitally necessary, not just for direct human interaction, but as a spur to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems. Why would we come to the aid of people who are suffering, the thinking goes, if we don\u2019t on some level feel their suffering, too?\n\nIf it is true that empathy is a necessary motivator for making the world a better place, what happens when we feel bombarded every day with the details of local and global disasters, with every shocking crime, political scandal and climate calamity here and abroad? The war in Syria. Refugee crises. Melting sea ice. Professionals on the frontlines of trauma are trained to watch for signs of \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d, but lately it feels as if everyone is at risk. After a year of news addiction that left me with insomnia and heart palpitations, I\u2019m starting to detach. Is there any way around it? What happens when the world wants more empathy than we can give?\n\nThe term \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d first appeared in print in a 1992 article by the writer and historian Carla Joinson. While observing nurses in emergency departments, Joinson noticed \u201ca unique form of burnout that affects people in the caregiving profession\u201d. A nurse named Jackie had recently lost her favourite patient, despite \u201cdesperate efforts\u201d to save her. Afterwards, Jackie had complained of \u201clingering feelings of helplessness and anger\u201d. Likewise, a surgical nurse named Marian reported going through a period of \u201cdespair and frustration\u201d that almost drove her to leave the profession \u2013 until she started to practise a kind of strategic remove.\n\nBefore it had an official name, something similar to compassion fatigue had been recognised in medical literature. By 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders claimed \u201cknowing of others\u2019 traumas can be traumatising\u201d. Though it was not yet well defined, there was a sense that proximity to trauma could itself be damaging, like secondhand smoke.\n\nIn the early 90s, Figley explored these ideas further. He identified how professionals providing \u201cempathic support\u201d to people with post-traumatic stress disorder can themselves begin to exhibit some of the same symptoms as their patients, such as anxiety and other emotional changes. According to Figley, trauma spreads to people who work in areas such as healthcare \u2013 not only because they are more likely to be exposed to those who are traumatised, but because caring is often inherent to their sense of self: empathy as a liability. Figley, who had served in Vietnam, went on to adopt and popularise Joinson\u2019s term, and became a major advocate for compassion fatigue awareness.\n\nIf you have ever cared for a sick parent, or child, you might recognise the symptoms of increased stress: the bad sleep, bad moods, bad stomach. I have experienced compassion fatigue as a caregiver myself. My husband has a chronic illness, and when he started getting ill, several years ago, we didn\u2019t know what was wrong. He would be struck with sudden vertigo and trapped on the couch, panicked, for hours. On other days, he was too dizzy to drive, or too unsteady to walk without a cane. Even more worryingly, his hearing started fluctuating, the levels changing from day to day, sometimes better in one ear and worse in the other. This made his work particularly difficult \u2013 he was teaching at a university at the time. Throughout it all, he had roaring tinnitus, which he compared to hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, jet engines, sirens, and on one occasion, a UFO landing. Some days he could barely hear anything, and it seemed that any day, he might wake up with no hearing at all, unable to work or communicate, even with me. John was in his 30s.\n\nBecause he couldn\u2019t reliably drive or talk on the phone, I became John\u2019s assistant, ferrying him to class when he was well enough to teach, cancelling his classes when he couldn\u2019t leave the house, calling doctors and insurance companies, driving to appointments. I still had a full-time job, too. I hated these new and sudden demands on my time and energy, but I hated even more how easily frustrated I would get. If he asked for help when I was busy, I would snap at him, then feel awful about it. Many nights we stayed up late, exhausted; we lay in the dark side by side, worrying and arguing.\n\n\u201cStress\u201d doesn\u2019t quite capture this era in our marriage; we felt terror and despair. I was afraid for John, yes, but I also felt alone, starved of compassion. I remember thinking (and maybe saying, shamefully) that I wanted someone to take care of me. I was pouring all my emotional resources toward John, and it seemed that he was hoarding his, spending all his feeling on himself. (And wasn\u2019t that natural? Aren\u2019t there times when we deserve to collect, rather than pay out, sympathy?) Studies have shown that stress, anxiety and uncertainty can reduce our levels of empathy. But it felt more like my empathy was being used up faster, due to greater demand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Compassion fatigue in healthcare workers can lead to increased clinical errors and high employee turnover. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe effects of compassion fatigue on healthcare workers are real and documented. Left untreated, it leads to reduced quality of care, an increase in clinical errors, and high employee turnover. Caregivers take these symptoms home, as well, harming their relationships with friends and family. Accordingly, caregivers are instructed to monitor themselves for signs of compassion fatigue. A textbook authored by Figley includes self-assessments to test your \u201cego resiliency\u201d, \u201cself-compassion\u201d and \u201cpost-traumatic growth\u201d \u2013 that is, the \u201cpositive changes that some trauma survivors report as a result of the struggle to cope with traumatic events\u201d. In the US, there seems to be a fixation on these positive narratives; thus, after a terrorist attack or similar disaster, some will claim it has made them \u201cstronger than ever\u201d \u2013 the Hollywood ending for real-world trauma.\n\nCaregivers are coached to follow various established guidelines of self-care in order to ward off compassion fatigue, or to recover if it has already struck. These include physical, psychological and social commitments such as maintaining healthy eating and sleeping habits, making time for relaxation and meditation, and building a social support network, including at least two people who can be counted on to be \u201chighly supportive\u201d. If trauma is communicable, one hopes those supporters have a support network of their own.\n\n\u201cOn any given workday, I\u2019m interacting with many people who are literally having the worst days of their lives,\u201d says an acquaintance of mine who works as a hospice nurse. But she is conscious of the risk of giving any one patient or family too much of her attention and energy. \u201cI don\u2019t try to put myself in my patients\u2019 shoes or try to feel what they\u2019re feeling \u2013 although this sometimes happens anyway,\u201d she told me. \u201cI need to maintain my emotional endurance by not using it all up in my first years of being a nurse.\u201d\n\nMy day job is nowhere near that harrowing; I work in marketing. But when I try to keep up the work of an informed citizen, I too feel that my emotional endurance is being tested. There\u2019s a sticky note on the wall by my desk that says: \u201cBE AN ACTIVIST.\u201d It has been there so long that I hardly see it anymore. I worry sometimes that I haven\u2019t paced my outrage.\n\nNot long after compassion fatigue emerged as a concept in healthcare, a similar concept began to appear in media studies \u2013 the idea that overexposure to horrific images, from news reports in particular, could cause viewers to shut down emotionally, rejecting information instead of responding to it. In her 1999 book Compassion Fatigue: How the Media Sell Disease, Famine, War and Death, the journalist and scholar Susan Moeller explored this idea at length. \u201cIt seems as if the media careen from one trauma to another, in a breathless tour of poverty, disease and death,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe troubles blur. Crises become one crisis.\u201d The volume of bad news drives the public to \u201ccollapse into a compassion fatigue stupor\u201d.\n\nSusan Sontag grappled with similar questions in her short book Regarding the Pain of Others, published in 2003. By \u201cregarding\u201d she meant not just \u201cwith regard to\u201d, but looking at: \u201cFlooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react. Compassion, stretched to its limits, is going numb. So runs the familiar diagnosis.\u201d She implies that the idea was already tired: media overload dulls our sensitivity to suffering. Whose fault is that \u2013 ours or the media\u2019s? And what are we supposed to do about it?\n\nBy Moeller\u2019s account, compassion fatigue is a vicious cycle. When war and famine are constant, they become boring \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it all before. The only way to break through your audience\u2019s boredom is to make each disaster feel worse than the last. When it comes to world news, the events must be \u201cmore dramatic and violent\u201d to compete with more local stories, as a 1995 study of international media coverage by the Pew Research Center in Washington found.\n\nAdvert-supported media channels survive on attention, and this leads to sensationalism and images meant to shock: starving, bloated children, cities ravaged by war. But these images, by design, are upsetting, and eventually we turn away \u2013 a form of self-preservation. And when a story isn\u2019t hot any more \u2013 that often meant low newspaper sales in the 90s; now it would be judged by a lack of clicks \u2013 the media tends to move on. As Tom Kent, a former international editor with the Associated Press, tells Moeller: \u201cWe cover things until there\u2019s not much new to say.\u201d In other words, crises often get boring before they get better.\n\nIn 1991, Moeller says, Americans focused more on cyclones and earthquakes than other, slower global crises, such as famine in Africa, because they saw the natural disasters as \u201cone-shot problems with specific solutions\u201d. There were clear ways to help, finite amounts of aid that would make a substantial difference. Famine, on the other hand, had been going on for years, despite it being a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the 80s, when benefit concerts and charity records had raised tens of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid. For many people, it had probably come to seem like an intractable crisis.\n\nThe fact that coverage of slowly unfolding, complex disasters tends to be limited is a problem; that the public aren\u2019t interested is another. But there may be a good reason for both, beyond moral decrepitude. Numbness or indifference to real atrocity may, from the outside, seem callous. But as Figley has argued, compassion fatigue, in the medical sense, stems from a desire to help. There is no compassion fatigue without compassion: the caregivers at risk see somebody suffering, and they want to reduce that suffering. But they can\u2019t always succeed. Compassion fatigue, then, is stymied compassion.\n\nIf caregivers are at risk because they give care to the traumatised, then empathetic news consumers are at risk because they consume the news. Just opening Twitter on your phone, or looking at the TV in a bar, exposes you to enormous problems you can\u2019t possibly solve. Perhaps you can help, but the difference that an individual contribution makes \u2013 placing a call, voting, going to a protest \u2013 often feels imperceptible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Media coverage of unfolding disasters, such as the Syria conflict, tends to be limited. Photograph: Abdulmonam Eassa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCompassion is generally seen as pure virtue, but is it always selfless? In The Science of Evil, psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen cites multiple studies that reveal an \u201cempathy circuit\u201d in the brain. These are the parts of the brain that usually activate when, for example, we look at a needle piercing someone else\u2019s hand \u2013 the psychology-experiment version of watching the scene in Un Chien Andalou, Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s surrealist film in which a man appears to slice through a woman\u2019s eyeball with a razor. (It\u2019s actually a sheep\u2019s eye.) I cringe and look away because on some automatic level I imagine it happening to me. In some sense, having empathy is a way of feeling compassion for myself.\n\nHuman propensity to empathy, Baron-Cohen claims, much like height and other traits, follows a normal distribution, the so-called bell curve. This means that a select few people have extraordinarily high levels of empathy \u2013 he offers anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu as an example \u2013 while some at the other end of the curve have zero empathy, including people with narcissistic personality disorder and psychopaths. (My mother once told me she had read that the two professions that test highest for psychopathy are surgeons and Buddhist monks \u2013 presumably because both require detachment. It sounds like dubious science, but does suggest another way in which empathy can be a liability: a barrier to objectivity or enlightenment.) The fact that most people are in the middle of the curve, Baron-Cohen writes, suggests that \u201cmoderate empathy levels are most adaptive\u201d. Most adaptive for what, we might ask \u2013 proliferation of the species, or good ethics? And are policies that favour local proliferation actively harmful to populations farther away?\n\nAverage empathy will fail some of the time; we will fail to feel what others are feeling, as the hospice nurse I know put it, even if we try. And this may be a rational response, whether conscious or automatic. Empathy, like any bodily process, has a cost. Hunger would be meaningless if it didn\u2019t make you eat. What good is compassion if it doesn\u2019t translate into concrete, external action? Perhaps it is rational to cut off the supply of emotion if it amounts to wasted energy.\n\nCan compassion fatigue be avoided, given our unprecedented access to appalling events around the world at every moment? Searching for solutions to apathy in the age of daily mass shootings, I found an article by a family therapist, written in November 2017:\n\n\u201cCan I be honest? When I read that [many of] the victims of the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs in Texas were children, I paused, then turned the page, disgusted and angry. Not just at the shooter, but at the people who died as well. It\u2019s awful to admit this, but I can\u2019t shake the thought that people died because they refused to listen to social scientists who kept telling them that guns cause gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe therapist identifies his victim-blaming reaction as a classic case of compassion fatigue, then outlines some solutions to the syndrome. First, the therapist suggests it is necessary to \u201cpersonalise the tragedy\u201d. \u201cRead the stories of each of the dead and connect with them as people, not nameless victims. This simple act of reading their stories can maintain compassion and protect us from apathy.\u201d (Can it, I wonder? This could be effective for any given mass shooting, but if we read up on the victims of every mass shooting, won\u2019t the hundreds of details begin to blur together?) Secondly: \u201cBe outraged \u2026 Don\u2019t give into the desire to withdraw.\u201d (This seems like telling someone the solution to cancer is \u201cdon\u2019t have cancer\u201d.) And third: \u201cIf you are still feeling burnt out emotionally, look for a tragedy closer to home.\u201d\n\nThis last tip struck me as particularly inane, as though compassion were an end in itself. Shouldn\u2019t we fight compassion fatigue because we worry that paralysis and apathy will make the world worse? I don\u2019t hope to increase my empathy for its own sake, especially by way of nearby tragedies. In any case, the tragedies are there \u2013 my husband\u2019s condition has been diagnosed, but that\u2019s what he would call a pyrrhic victory; the condition is deteriorating and has no known cure. I have a friend whose wife is dying of cancer; he has had to pay for her treatment through crowdfunding campaigns. This isn\u2019t unusual. Everyone has their own local tragedy.\n\nMoeller claims compassion fatigue is not inevitable, and that the media can fight it by providing coverage that is neither formulaic nor sensationalised. \u201cMore graphic is not better,\u201d she writes. Sontag, for her part, believed fatigue was a reasonable response to a barrage of terrible images: \u201cSomeone who is perennially surprised that depravity exists, who continues to feel disillusioned (even incredulous) when confronted with evidence of what humans are capable of inflicting in the way of gruesome, hands-on cruelties upon other humans, has not reached moral or psychological adulthood.\u201d In this view, compassion fatigue is a coming of age.\n\nOn the other hand, if we feel entitled to apathy, or even self-righteous about our apathy, it can become an easy excuse for moral laziness. In 2000, the New Yorker published a cartoon that showed two men in suits walking past a disgruntled-looking homeless man asking for money. One suit says to the other: \u201cHere I was, all this time, worrying that maybe I\u2019m a selfish person, and now it turns out I\u2019ve been suffering from compassion fatigue.\u201d\n\nI have reached the point where being shocked feels normal; it is a fact I hold in my mind but don\u2019t feel in my body. I would like to follow the guidelines of self-care, to preserve my \u201cemotional endurance\u201d, not as a professional caregiver, just as a regular person who cares about the world. So I take breaks and try to reduce my stress. I go out with friends, I watch old poker tournaments on YouTube. But my breaks are getting longer. They feel dangerously close to avoidance.\n\nThat distance is better, I suppose, than feeling hopelessly enraged. But what is my responsibility? How much am I supposed to know about global suffering, and what can I really do with that knowledge? Social media, 24-hour news, alerts on my phone \u2013 the demands on our compassion are much higher than a caveman or Kant had to contend with. It is overwhelming, even paralysing, and very likely makes me less effectual in the local spaces where I might actually be able to do some good. Whether or not I keep up with everything happening everywhere, all the time, I know that the information exists; that awareness alone is fatiguing. It\u2019s very easy to succumb to fatalism, which is perhaps the logical extension of compassion fatigue \u2013 believing that we\u2019re screwed no matter what we do is mysteriously tempting.\n\nDo we need to feel bad in order to do good? The psychologist Paul Bloom, who wrote a book called Against Empathy, argues \u2013 or perhaps hopes \u2013 that we can be moral without depending on empathy, which is biased and unreliable. We shouldn\u2019t dole out aid in accordance with the amount of sympathy we feel for people; we should help the people who need the most help. The answer, in Bloom\u2019s mind, is not to dial up our sympathy for everyone to unsustainable levels, but dial it down so we can approach problems more logically. Even Baron-Cohen, who equates \u201cempathy erosion\u201d with evil, concedes that there are people with zero empathy who are also rigidly moral; they do it by systematising right and wrong. This seems to prove that good ethics don\u2019t depend on the feeling of empathy. However, most of us are not that systematic.\n\nExtreme altruism: should you care for strangers at the expense of your family? | Larissa MacFarquhar Read more\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day in 2017, John and I invited an activist we know over for dinner, an older man with much more experience in organising than us.

The project is often described as a 21st century silk road, made up of a \u201cbelt\u201d of overland corridors and a maritime \u201croad\u201d of shipping lanes. China is carrying out or planning construction projects in more than 60 countries along these routes.\n\nBeijing\u2019s multibillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been called a Chinese Marshall Plan, a state-backed campaign for global dominance, a stimulus package for a slowing economy, and a massive marketing campaign for something that was already happening \u2013 Chinese investment around the world.\n\nOver the five years since President Xi Jinping announced his grand plan to connect Asia, Africa and Europe, the initiative has morphed into a broad catchphrase to describe almost all aspects of Chinese engagement abroad.\n\nBelt and Road, or yi dai yi lu, is a \u201c21st century silk road,\u201d confusingly made up of a \u201cbelt\u201d of overland corridors and a maritime \u201croad\u201d of shipping lanes.\n\nFrom South-east Asia to Eastern Europe and Africa, Belt and Road includes 71 countries that account for half the world\u2019s population and a quarter of global GDP.\n\nEverything from a Trump-affiliated theme park in Indonesia to a jazz camp in Chongqing have been branded Belt and Road. Countries from Panama to Madagascar, South Africa to New Zealand, have officially pledged support.\n\nHow much money is being spent?\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is expected to cost more than $1tn (\u00a3760bn), although there are differing estimates as to how much money has been spent to date. According to one analysis, China has invested more than $210bn, the majority in Asia.\n\nBut China\u2019s efforts abroad don\u2019t stop there. Belt and Road also means that Chinese firms are engaging in construction work across the globe on an unparalleled scale.\n\nAccording to one estimate, China has invested more than $200 bn into Belt and Road projects abroad. 1/3 Source: American Enterprise Institute. Values shown are cumulative\n\nTo date, Chinese companies have secured more than $340bn in construction contracts along the Belt and Road.\n\nHowever, China\u2019s dominance in the construction sector comes at the expense of local contractors in partner countries.\n\nThe vast sums raked in by Chinese firms are at odds with the official rhetoric that Belt and Road is open to global participation and suggest that the initiative is also motivated by factors other than trade, such as China\u2019s need to combat excess capacity at home.\n\nWhat are the risks for countries involved?\n\nMore recently, governments from Malaysia to Pakistan are starting to rethink the costs of these projects. Sri Lanka, where the government leased a port to a Chinese company for 99 years after struggling to make repayments, is a cautionary tale.\n\nEarlier this year, the Center for Global Development found eight more Belt and Road countries at serious risk of not being able to repay their loans.\n\nThe affected nations \u2013 Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, the Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan and Tajikistan \u2013 are among the poorest in their respective regions and will owe more than half of all their foreign debt to China.\n\nCritics worry China could use \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d to extract strategic concessions \u2013 such as over territorial disputes in the South China Sea or silence on human rights violations. In 2011, China wrote off an undisclosed debt owed by Tajikistan in exchange for 1,158 sq km (447 sq miles) of disputed territory.\n\n\u201cThere are some extreme cases where China lends into very high risk environments, and it would seem that the motivation is something different. In these situations the leverage China has as lender is used for purposes unrelated to the original loan,\u201d said Scott Morris, one of the authors of the Washington Centre for Global Development report.\n\nWhy is the initiative sparking global concern?\n\nAs Belt and Road expands in scope so do concerns it is a form of economic imperialism that gives China too much leverage over other countries, often those that are smaller and poorer.\n\nJane Golley, an associate professor at Australian National University, describes it as an attempt to win friends and influence people. \u201cThey\u2019ve presented this very grand initiative which has frightened people,\u201d says Golley. \u201cRather than using their economic power to make friends, they\u2019ve drummed up more fear that it will be about influence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shan Wenhua, a professor at Jiaotong University in Xi\u2019an, Xi\u2019s signature foreign policy is \u201cthe first major attempt by the Chinese government to take a proactive approach toward international cooperation \u2026 to take responsibility.\u201d\n\nSome worry expanded Chinese commercial presence around the world will eventually lead to expanded military presence. Last year, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti. Analysts say almost all the ports and other transport infrastructure being built can be dual-use for commercial and military purposes.\n\n\u201cIf it can carry goods, it can carry troops,\u201d says Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia project at CSIS.\n\nOthers worry China will export its political model. Herbert Wiesner, general secretary of Germany\u2019s PEN Center, says human rights are being \u201cleft in the ditches by the sides of the New Silk Road\u201d.\n\nWhere does it end?\n\nBelt and Road is likely to continue, not least because these projects signal loyalty to Xi. The initiative has been enshrined in the Chinese communist party\u2019s constitution, which also eliminated term limits, leaving Xi room to continue Belt and Road for as long as he wants.\n\nIt also gives disparate Chinese projects overseas the veneer of being part of a grand strategic plan, according to Winslow Robertson, a specialist in China-Africa relations. It is not a centralised initiative, so much as a brand, he says.\n\n\u201cWho determines what is a Belt and Road project or a Belt and Road country? Nobody is sure. Everything and nothing is Belt and Road.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nNot all of the most ambitious Belt and Road projects are about hard infrastructure. China plans to set up international courts, in Shenzhen and Xi\u2019an, the former hub of the original Silk Road, to resolve commercial disputes related to Belt and Road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder BRI is about more than roads, railways, and other hard infrastructure,\u201d said Jonathan Hillman, director of the Reconnecting Asia project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s also a vehicle for China to write new rules, establish institutions that reflect Chinese interests, and reshape \u2018soft\u2019 infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said the courts, to be based on the judiciary, arbitration and mediation agencies of China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing, will follow international rules and will invite legal experts from outside China to participate.\n\nLegal experts say the courts will likely be modelled on the Dubai International Financial Centre Courts and the International Commercial Court in Singapore, which has already struck an agreement with China to resolve Belt and Road-related disputes.\n\nBut critics of the independence of the country\u2019s judicial system, which traditionally answers to China\u2019s ruling communist party, worry the courts will favour Chinese parties over foreign firms.", "sentiment": 0.061226923076923075, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "What is China's Belt and Road Initiative?"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/02/tiger-woods-firestone-first-round", "text": "Tiger Woods returned to Firestone and had his lowest opening round of the year at the Bridgestone Invitational.\n\n'Winner-take-all' match between Tiger and Phil reportedly set for November Read more\n\nIt was barely enough to keep pace.\n\nConditions were so soft and vulnerable Thursday that Kyle Stanley opened with a 7-under 63 among the early starters, and even that might not be enough to stay in the lead by the end of the first round.

Hundreds of mountains and village after village have been bulldozed since construction of Gansu province\u2019s Lanzhou New Area began in 2012.\n\nA free trade zone has been created, an artificial lake carved into the arid soil, and more than 400 miles of road and scores of high-rise towers built. English-language billboards sing the praises of one of China\u2019s newest cities in a chorus of giant multi-coloured adjectives: \u201cOutstanding! Bustling! New World!\u201d\n\nBut the Communist party\u2019s urban planners have not stopped there. Desperate to lure outsiders to this far-flung, sparsely populated region, officials have ordered the construction of a replica of the Great Sphinx of Egypt; the Parthenon; Beijing\u2019s Summer Palace and Forbidden City, and even of a stretch of the Great Wall of China.\n\nLast but not least, they threw in the Dinosaur Kingdom, a sprawling Triassic theme park where Chinese tourists will soon be able to gaze at super-sized models of flesh-eating theropods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mini-Disneyland,\u201d gushed Xu Haike, a local hotelier who recently moved to the city and is among those banking on its success.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chinese tourists visiting the replica of the Parthenon. Photograph: Tom Phillips\n\n\u2018Go west\u2019\n\nLanzhou New Area was conceived as part of a broader government push to develop China\u2019s west that kicked off near the turn of the century.\n\nIt is located about 40 miles north of Gansu\u2019s gritty capital, Lanzhou \u2013 a smog-choked industrial hub carved in two by the meandering Yellow river. The old city has about 3.6 million residents; 160,000 of whom are are members of the Hui Muslim minority. The region has long been known for its contaminated air, water and soil, although recent years have seen authorities attempting to clean up, with some success.\n\nPeople are buying property and moving in. As improbable as it sounds, it\u2019s kind of coming to life Wade Shepard\n\nThe so-called \u201cGo West\u201d initiative \u2013 a bid to bring a touch of China\u2019s prosperous eastern coast to its underdeveloped interior \u2013 called for less-developed provinces such as Qinghai, Sichuan and Gansu to be given a dramatic facelift.\n\n\n\nAs well as building tens of thousands of miles of road and railway, plans were also unveiled for a series of new urban hubs scattered across the country\u2019s south and north-west.\n\nWade Shepard, an American writer who has spent more than a decade chronicling the fortunes of these new areas, said the campaign sparked a construction frenzy across inland China that peaked after the 2008 financial crisis, as Beijing hurled vast sums at infrastructure projects in a bid to shore up growth.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a free for all. Government officials were basically told to go out and increase GDP to comply with this national urbanisation movement, and pretty much every level of government had the authority to build new cities. So they went out and they built and they built and they built,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest And this is how it will look \u2026 a development advertised in Lanzhou New Area. Photograph: Corinne Rozotte\n\nThere was, however, a catch.\n\nIn many cases, the masses did not immediately flock to these new cities and so a notorious generation of Chinese \u201cghost cities\u201d was born: hollow urban shells that were apparently home to more cranes than humans.\n\n\u201cWhen they were just being built it was otherworldly. You are walking through these massive new cities \u2013 some of them the size of Manhattan or even bigger \u2013 and you can\u2019t really believe what you are seeing,\u201d said Shepard, who charts the rise of such cities in his book Ghost Cities of China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all these huge, massive buildings and everything that you would attribute to a city: malls, banks and government offices. But there are no people. It\u2019s kind of like you are in a dream or this Twilight Zone episode where you suddenly wake up and everyone else is gone and you are the last man on earth.\u201d\n\nLanzhou New Area was one of the last such state-level new areas to be given the green light before Xi Jinping, the president, came to power in late 2012. Apparently alarmed by the soaring levels of local debt, he started to rein in such mega-projects as the country sought a more sustainable urbanisation model.\n\nWhen the city was approved by Beijing just months before Xi\u2019s presidency, authorities announced a series of staggering targets for their city in the sands.\n\nBy 2020, Lanzhou New Area was to have five hospitals, 75 schools and creches, and a GDP of 100bn yuan (\u00a311.8bn). By 2030 it would be home to one million full-time residents and its GDP would have almost tripled, to 270bn yuan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Residents of Lanzhou New Area praise living conditions but worry about the lack of jobs. Photograph: Corinne Rozotte\n\nThe project, which involved levelling hundreds of barren hills, was called \u201cthe greatest mountain-moving project on earth\u201d and a Hollywood-style trailer with a stirring soundtrack offered a dynamic, neon-lit glimpse of the city\u2019s future. It was a place of economic prowess and leisure and hi-tech industry, where happy residents strolled through verdant parks or raced across the city\u2019s lake in speedboats.\n\n\n\nAn English-language website promised potential investors that Lanzhou New Area would witness \u201cmassive economic build-up\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe best thing is the infrastructure. The roads. The squares. The biggest problem is that there aren\u2019t any people Zhang Yongshuai\n\nReality took a while to catch up with the dream. When I first visited in 2013, as villagers came to terms with the destruction of their once-remote rural homes, an eerie hush gripped the city\u2019s almost completely empty streets. The relentless din of car horns \u2013 a trademark of urban China \u2013 was completely absent. Dozens of tower blocks were under construction but, aside from builders, there was hardly a soul to be seen. Both Chinese and foreign journalists who flocked to the city came away convinced it was a flop.\n\nReturning four years later, however, I found this sleeping western giant appears to be slowly awakening as housing projects begin to fill up and pioneers start to move in.\n\n\u201cPeople are buying property and moving in,\u201d insists Shepard, who has visited the city twice. \u201cAs improbable as it sounds, it\u2019s kind of coming to life. The place is almost like a mirage out in the middle of the desert. You see it glimmer on the horizon. You see it but you don\u2019t really believe it is there \u2013 and then all of a sudden you are in the middle of it.\u201d\n\nCity officials declined to be interviewed by the Guardian about their progress in luring humans to the region\u2019s lunar landscape. But during a government propaganda tour last year, Xu Dawu, Lanzhou New Area\u2019s deputy Communist party secretary, claimed it had already attracted 150,000 permanent residents as well as 40,000 construction workers who were temporarily living there.\n\nThose numbers seem wildly inflated with huge swaths of the city still completely vacant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A construction zone in Lanzhou New Area. Photograph: Corinne Rozotte\n\n\u201cThe project is ongoing,\u201d Li Zhenjiang, an estate agent, explained sheepishly as he took a break inside an otherwise completely derelict, dust-covered shopping mall that appeared to have been abandoned for months, if not years.\n\nA report by state broadcaster CCTV last year claimed the actual number of residents was closer to 40,000, many of them local farmers who were relocated to tower blocks in the city after their homes were razed, or the employees of state-owned companies who had been ordered to relocate there. A more modest figure of 80,000 permanents can now be found on the city\u2019s website.\n\nWhatever the real figure, pockets of life are now springing up across town as people trickle into the city in search of a better future.\n\n\u201cI came here last August,\u201d said Zhang Yongshuai, a shopkeeper who moved here from the provincial capital, Lanzhou, with his two young boys. Zhang said he had been drawn to this urbanisation frontier by the lower rents and the prospect of a new life. He rented a ground-floor shop in a sprawling but still virtually empty residential complex of high-rises and luxury villas called the Greenland Intelligent Financial Town.\n\n\u201cThe best thing is the infrastructure, the roads, the squares. The living environment is better than Lanzhou,\u201d said the 23-year-old.\n\nZhang admitted the city had not lived up to all of his expectations. \u201cThe biggest problem is there aren\u2019t any people,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cBut I think they will come. If there were no people here then it would all have been a big waste, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Children in Rainbow Town, the busiest part of Lanzhou New Area. Photograph: Tom Phillips\n\nA few blocks away, one of Zhang\u2019s few neighbours, Zhou Fei, said he also felt good about the city\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s getting busier,\u201d said Zhou, who was born and raised in Dongshuitang, one of the rural communities that was destroyed to make way for the new city, and bought a flat here with the compensation handed to his family by the government.\n\nZhou\u2019s wife, Bao Shan, said she was still unimpressed with the sluggish pace of life and of change. Only about 20 families were currently living in the community of high-rises they now called home. \u201cI don\u2019t like the quietness,\u201d she said. \u201cBusiness isn\u2019t great.\u201d\n\nBut Zhou was convinced a less ghostly future lay ahead \u2013 and in any case there was now no turning back. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left [of our village]. It\u2019s all demolished,\u201d he explained.\n\nAnother immigrant hoping the city will take off is Xu Haike, who moved to Lanzhou New Area last May to help manage the city\u2019s only luxury guesthouse, the Binhu International Garden hotel.\n\nXu said the city\u2019s portrayal as a ghost town was still half accurate, but insisted business at his 76-room hotel was steadily improving. The average occupancy rate was now about 70%, Xu said during an interview in the hotel\u2019s deathly quiet lobby, although on the day of the Guardian\u2019s visit he said only 30% of rooms were occupied.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A welcome sign in a residential zone. Photograph: Corinne Rozotte\n\nThe city, too, was gradually filling up, although at night the dearth of switched-on lights suggested it still had a way to go. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have built the house but the furniture hasn\u2019t arrived yet,\u201d Xu joked.\n\nOne of the city\u2019s liveliest corners is the 20,000-strong Rainbow Town estate, a concrete jungle of high-rise flats thrown up for displaced villagers whose homes were bulldozed, and migrant workers helping to build the rest of the city around them.\n\nOn a recent afternoon dozens of children could be seen racing past a multicoloured government creche towards a bustling main square.\n\nIn \u200bfive to eight years the New Area will be more developed.

The living conditions have improved but the bad part is that there aren\u2019t job opportunities for us here.\u201d\n\nLiu said she was relieved her daughter was no longer forced to use an outdoor toilet as she had done in their village. \u201cDuring the winter it was terrible for the kids.

Last year, one government thinktank reportedly claimed that the new areas would eventually have enough space to house about 3.4 billion residents, more than double the population of the whole of China.\n\n\n\nBut Shepard said he was convinced about the incipient awakening of places such as Lanzhou New Area and suggested the world had been too quick to write off China\u2019s new cities, preferring to embrace the sensational but inaccurate narrative of ghost cities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zhou Fei and Bao Shan with their daughter.

So they say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s 2003. By 2023 we will have 300,000 people living here or we\u2019ll have one million people living here.\u2019\n\n\u201cEven now we are looking at projects that are kind of in the halfway point and nobody should reasonably expect any country in the world to be able to build a completely new city in six years and populate it, right? It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government doesn\u2019t care what the west thinks of their new cities, because they know the plan and they know how these places develop and they know that there is really no such thing as a ghost city. It\u2019s pretty much just a phase of development, between the time the initial downtown core of a city is built and 15 years later when they are completely connected to the urban and national transport network.\u201d\n\nLanzhou New Area\u2019s pioneers are banking on that evaluation proving correct.\n\nSand mining: the global environmental crisis you\u2019ve never heard of Read more\n\nThe city\u2019s inclusion in a major economic development drive unveiled by Xi during his first year in office \u2013the so-called Silk Road economic belt \u2013 has raised hopes that the local economy will, eventually, lift off.\n\n\u201cNow it is a national-level project so that means it will be successful,\u201d said Shepard. \u201cThere is no other option. It\u2019s too big to fail.\u201d\n\nZhou, the shopkeeper, said he believed his new home might even one day rival the provincial capital after which it is named. \u201cIn five to eight years the New Area will be more developed. It will feel just like Lanzhou,\u201d he predicted.\n\nXu, the hotel owner, scoffed at that idea. \u201cIt is not the political centre of [Gansu province], nor is it the economic centre.\u201d But he said he had faith that things were on the up. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about the future.\u201d\n\nAnd as cities such as Lanzhou New Area slowly find their feet, Shepard said the world would need to find a new way of referring to China\u2019s increasingly lively ghost cities. \u201cI guess now you would just call them cities.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Zhen\n\n\n\nGuardian Cities is dedicating a week to the huge but often unreported cities on the front line of China\u2019s unprecedented urbanisation.

Pretty much any opportunity: BBC national radio, BBC TV, Channel 4, Sky \u2013 I\u2019ve done them all over the years, for good or ill. Even when, as is not infrequently the case, the deck is somewhat stacked against me, or the timing inadequate for anything more than a soundbite, or the question up for debate less than ideal.\n\nBut this Wednesday, when I was rung up by BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and asked to come on air to debate with a climate change denier, something in me broke, and rebelled. Really? I thought. This summer, of all times?\n\nSo, for almost the first time in my life, I turned it down. I told it that I will no longer be part of such charades. I said that the BBC should be ashamed of its nonsensical idea of \u201cbalance\u201d, when the scientific debate is as settled as the \u201cdebate\u201d about whether smoking causes cancer. By giving climate change deniers a full platform, producers make their position seem infinitely more reasonable than it is. (This contributes to the spread of misinformation and miseducation around climate change that fuels the inaction producing the long emergency we are facing.)\n\nFrom a public service broadcaster, this is simply not good enough.\n\nWas this the scorcher that finally ended climate denial? | Michael McCarthy Read more\n\nWhat makes it so frustrating is that there are important debates to be had around climate change. And so I told the Beeb that I would be very happy to come on and take part in a different debate. For example, we should be debating whether the Paris climate accord is going to be enough, or if we need to do more. Or discussing just how radically our society needs to change to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, and how we should rethink our activism.\n\nBut I will no longer put up with the absurd notion that a straight debate about the science can be justified, especially given the fundamental truth that we\u2019ve known for decades: that even if there were any real room for doubt about the science, we should still take radical action to safeguard a liveable climate, on the basis of the Precautionary Principle. This principle of international law states that even the absence of certainty about the risk of widespread and catastrophic harm to the environment or public health ought not to stop us from taking preventive action to head off such potentially ruinous harms.\n\nBBC Cambridgeshire is based in Cambridge, the science capital of the UK. I expected better from it, especially after the well-publicised ruling this year that the way that the BBC has been promoting climate change deniers on air is no longer acceptable.\n\nIn the end, the broadcast went ahead without me. Much of it wasn\u2019t bad. The scientists interviewed were excellent. But the framing of the debate was awful, and framing is everything, so far as the message that most listeners receive is concerned. The presenter introduced the segment by asking, \u201cIs climate change real?\u201d The journalist doing vox pops bombarded ordinary people with canards such as, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a natural cycle?\u201d And, of course, a climate change denier was given a huge and undeserved platform on an equal basis to his opponent.\n\nIn August 2018, this is unacceptable and it seems that quite a lot of people agree with me.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s the exciting thing. If we get more momentum behind the idea of refusing to participate, it will force a change of coverage methods by the BBC, which experts have been calling for for years. For if we all refuse to debate with the climate change deniers on public platforms, and press the BBC to catch up with the 21st century, it will be forced to change its ways, because the BBC cannot defend the practice of allowing a climate change denier to speak unopposed. If we truly want to see change on this issue, we need to be willing to let it know exactly how we feel.

You saw Hong Kong through neon lighting or because of neon lighting,\u201d says Aric Chen, lead curator of design and architecture at the M+museum, focused on Hong Kong\u2019s visual culture.\n\nMaintenance works are sometimes completed in a few minutes, with (seemingly) very few safety measures involved\n\n\n\nBefore the museum opened its doors, Chen curated M+\u2019s first online exhibition in 2014, a highly popular website that celebrated the city\u2019s neon installations, fuelling a nostalgic movement to rediscover them.\n\n\u201cThey are indelibly linked to what the city is in the popular imagination, and when we did this project we really struck a chord,\u201d Chen says.\n\nBuoyed by that interest, projects such as the Hong Kong Neon Heritage Group, founded in January 2017, are trying to gather information about the last few standing neon signs and raise awareness of their disappearance. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see neon signs in a museum, as dead objects, we want to see them shining in the streets,\u201d says Cardin Chan, one of the members of the initiative, which organises neon-related workshops.\n\nGraphic designers and artists have bought into the initiative\u2019s goals, creating new indoor neon signs and installations, and pushing for the revival of an icon of Hong Kong\u2019s identity. \u201cA lot of culture coming from China is influencing Hong Kong in different ways,\u201d says Kwok. \u201cPeople are becoming aware of the disappearance of Hong Kong\u2019s culture, and want to retain it,\u201d he says.\n\nA neon sign welcomes customers to Anchoret cafe and boutique shop, in Sai Ying Pun neighbourhood\n\n\n\nNeon lights lighten the mood inside the cozy Mum\u2019s not Home bar\n\nThis comeback has helped some of the companies still creating and installing neon billboards to find a new way to survive after years of losses. After more than three decades in the business, Frank Sin decided to launch his own company at the end of May, Frank Sin Neon Light Business, which manufactures and provides maintenance for neon lights. In less than a month, his new workshop has already received six orders. This new business-owner says that the demand for neon lights went up in 2012, when local artists and designers, sometimes returning from overseas, became aware of Hong Kong\u2019s characteristic neon heritage. \u201cEven earlier I would convince some customers to use neon lights instead of LED,\u201d he says.\n\nThe gentle glow of neon lights has illuminated Hong Kong\u2019s streets and alleyways for decades\n\n\n\nNeon signs used to combine red-coloured Chinese characters with a green pattern surrounding them, making the inscriptions easier to read\n\n\n\nThe neon light of the first restaurants from the Hong Kong Tsui Wah chain, combines Japanese and Chinese characters and Western letters, and it\u2019s one of the last large neon signs standing in the Jordan neighbourhood\n\n\n\nBut others don\u2019t think this is a sustainable model. Wu Chi-Kai, one of the last neon lights craftsmen working in Hong Kong, says that his workshop can\u2019t be sustained \u201cthrough small-scale projects\u201d and says that his workshop\u2019s revenue is down 80% from 25 years ago. At the same time, technicians able to repair fragile neon tubes are more difficult to find than ever and their services are becoming pricier, shopkeepers complain. The result is that even the most iconic signs still standing in the streets might have two or three colour tubes burned out, or some of the parts blinking gloomily.\n\n\n\nWu Chi-Kai, one of the last glass benders in Hong Kong, says that he has stayed in the profession because he likes \u201cthe challenge\u201d of creating new, impossible-looking designs\n\n\n\nAnd a new control system for outdoor structures around buildings was implemented by Hong Kong authorities at the end of 2011.\n\nSince then, many business owners have been receiving notifications asking to resize local neon signs to comply with local ordinance. According to the 2014 M+ museum online exhibition, the government has removed 3,000 unauthorised signboards a year since 2006. When I visited Koon Nam Wah bridal shop, a traditional shop for Chinese embroidered wedding dresses, the owner said that its neon lights had just been repaired but that they would probably not last much longer.\n\n\n\nThe neon advertisement of Koon Nam Wah bridal store \u201cwill disappear soon,\u201d according to the owner of the shop\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are just waiting for the final notice [from the authorities] to change the neon light for LED,\u201d says Lam Chok-Yi, owner of Koon Nam Wah \u2013 now one of the last shops displaying a neon sign in Yau MaTei, a blue-collar neighbourhood.\n\n\u201cSociety changes, and we have to follow the rules,\u201d she says.", "sentiment": 0.13763611111111113, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Hong Kong\u2019s fight to save its neon shimmer \u2013 a photo essay"}, {"published": "2018-07-04T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2018/jul/04/after-you-the-psychology-of-queues-and-how-to-beat-them-video-explainer", "text": "Queues are simple: you join at the back and wait your turn.

A strange sound came out of my mouth. It was not the high-pitched shriek that I thought I would make on seeing a two metre-long python coming at me. It was more of a guttural yell, like I had been hit at close range in the face with a basketball.\n\n\u201cArrgh,\u201d I yelled. \u201cArrghhh, help!\u201d\n\nMy aunt came running out.

The aesthetic effect of the snake against the cabinet was strangely pleasing (they matched) but the emotional effect of seeing such a large wild animal near my laptop was fear and disbelief.\n\nTrue Queenslanders, my aunt and uncle looked at the snake with nonchalance, as if it was a rainbow lorikeet or an ibis in their garden.\n\nNo, they had not seen it before. Maybe it had come from the creek. Yes, it was big. I cowered behind them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harmless,\u201d said my uncle. \u201cLook, it\u2019s just eaten.\u201d\n\nThe snake looked like it had swallowed a large possum. A bulge in its middle was preventing it from moving through the slats of the gazebo. Like a fat man trying to get into skinny jeans \u2013 it sort of gave up and just hung out there. Would it just stay in that position until it had shat out the possum?\n\nThat\u2019s if it was a possum ...\n\nLast year while travelling in Indonesia, I had become transfixed by a news story about a farmer who had been swallowed whole by a python. He had been missing for a while, when the python \u2013 with a suspiciously large lump in its body \u2013 was \u201cspotted slithering awkwardly in Salubiro village\u201d.\n\nIt was captured, cut open and the man\u2019s body was found inside fully clothed. Fully clothed!\n\nI thought about Pink. This was all her fault. I had tweeted: \u201cLiterally this th!nk piece on P!nk is going to be the death of me. And then a two-metre long python appears.\u201d\n\nIt was as if the snake was summoned, just like what happens in the Bible, when shit\u2019s about to get real. Because a snake of course, is never just a snake. It\u2019s a very powerful symbol that humans have used in storytelling and myth throughout the ages, not just as a metaphor but as a portent.\n\n\u201cWhat do you portend, snake?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe snake did not move for a while, and my uncle assured me it was safe to continue working.\n\nFocusing on the Pink think piece was now impossible. I jumped at shadows, I looked at my handbag and thought I saw it moving.\n\nThe sheer existence of the snake up in the eaves \u2013 digesting \u2013 was a fact that shook me somehow, like it was an apparition or holy vision that seemed unbelievable even though I was staring right at it.\n\n\u201cLook at that snake,\u201d I kept murmuring to no one in particular. \u201cJust look at it.\u201d\n\nI tweeted pictures of the snake and the division on Twitter was sharp: there were those that replied in ALL CAPS that I should set the snake on fire or behead it with a shovel and those who said the snake was beautiful and unique, and I was very lucky to see one so close.\n\nFor the next 24 hours I wandered outside, looked up at the snake \u2013 which had not moved \u2013 and would say aloud: \u201cThe snake \u2013 it\u2019s still there.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the snake, its still there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOMG, it\u2019s big!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder if there are any road workers missing?\u201d\n\nI was not prepared for home ownership.

It hadn\u2019t given me the evil eye or hissed or shown any inclination that it might eat me.\n\nIt was wild and beautiful, and although I shouldn\u2019t touch it, I realised I shouldn\u2019t be scared of it either.

Although the city was never completed, some traces remain\n\nAt first glance, this North Carolina town would have looked much like the thousands of others that were built across America\u2019s vast countryside in the decades following the second world war. It would have consisted of single family homes on curvilinear streets within walking distance of manmade lakes, shopping centres and industry. In short, a 1970s vision of suburbia.\n\n\n\nOne key factor would have made this town different, however. The self-contained, racially integrated community would be planned, developed and managed by black people. Those black foundations would be celebrated in the town\u2019s name: Soul City.\n\nThe idea was dreamed up by Floyd McKissick: attorney, civil rights activist and force of nature. In January 1969, amid the waning days of US president Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s administration, McKissick strolled into a Washington DC news conference with secretary of agriculture Orville Freeman and announced plans to build Soul City on 5,000 acres of rural land in impoverished Warren County, just over an hour\u2019s drive from Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nThat was the easy part. While Johnson supported the effort and pledged government help, McKissick\u2019s real task began five days later when a new president was sworn in: the politically conservative Richard Nixon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Floyd McKissick poses with an architect\u2019s rendering of the Soultech 1 industrial park. Photograph: Harold Valentine/AP\n\nHaving secured the US\u2019s southern states, including North Carolina, in the 1968 presidential election using a decidedly anti-black campaign tactic called the \u201csouthern strategy\u201d, the prospect of Nixon backing $14m-worth (\u00a39.7m) of federal loan guarantees to support the construction of this new town \u2013 built and managed by black people and called, of all things, Soul City \u2013 looked remote. Yet that\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nConstruction on this \u201csouthern utopia\u201d began within a few years. And for a while at least, it looked as if McKissick \u2013 an African American who had marched with Martin Luther King in the violent south and successfully sued for admission to the University of North Carolina School of Law \u2013 had prevailed again.\n\n\u201cThe black man has been searching for identity and destiny in the cities,\u201d McKissick said in that 1969 news conference. \u201cHe should be able to find it in the plains of Warren County.\u201d\n\nThe rise of soul\n\nSoul City came at time when black culture was taking a larger role in the American mainstream. In 1968, a show called Soul! \u2013 conceived as a black version of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson \u2013 had premiered on New York public television. There were black sitcoms, and soul music began to cross over to the pop charts with frequency. The nationally syndicated dance show Soul Train premiered in 1971.\n\n\n\nMajor cities such as Los Angeles and Atlanta elected black mayors for the first time. Also, in 1971, hair care company Chicago\u2019s Johnson Products became the first minority-owned firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Given the context, a black city did not seem out of the realm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest American civil rights activists Martin Luther King, Floyd McKissick and Stokely Carmichael in Canton, Mississippi. Photograph: Everett Collection Historical/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nMcKissick foresaw a town that would grow to 44,000 residents by 2004. There would be homes and industry surrounded by trees, hills and lakes. Above all, there would be no prejudice, poverty or slums, according to a Soul City brochure. For a black person in the segregated urban ghettos of the north, the message was clear: \u201cCome back home.\u201d\n\nFloyd McKissick Jr, son of the Soul City founder and formerly the development\u2019s planning chief, says that company officials visited and made direct appeals to black families in the north \u2013 many of whom had left the south just a generation earlier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, we\u2019d give a \u2018dog a pony\u2019 show (a slide presentation) that could be used exactly for that purpose,\u201d McKissick Jr recalls. \u201cPeople living in Harlem and in Newark ... even if they were working hard and making a living, the price of buying a home was unaffordable. And if they did buy something, they weren\u2019t getting much for their money.\u201d\n\nDespite its name, Soul City was never intended to be an all-black town, but rather, a multi-racial community built and managed by black people. To tamp down perceptions that he was building a racially exclusive town, the senior McKissick briefly considered changing its name to Open City.\n\nSoul City was born under the federal government\u2019s Model Cities programme, which began in 1966. A plank in President Johnson\u2019s anti-poverty efforts, it funded housing, employment, infrastructure and planning. Of the programme\u2019s 14 new developments, Soul City was the only one to be built from scratch, with no pre-existing infrastructure \u2013 and the only one by a black developer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An ad for Soul City. Illustration: HUD\n\nMcKissick hired the black New York architecture firm Ifill, Johnson & Hanchard to turn the rolling North Carolina acreage into Soul City. The project got urban planning assistance from the very school he had sued more than 20 years earlier: the University of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cIt had probably looked pretty much the same since the 1700s and 1800s,\u201d McKissick Jr says of the site. \u201cSo you were transforming the land, laying out plans for it.\u201d\n\nIn a county where slaves toiled in cotton and tobacco plantations barely a century earlier, the planners envisioned a broad Soul City boulevard leading south into the development from nearby Interstate 85. The road would pass Soul City\u2019s executive office complex and the industrial park Soultech 1. After passing a manmade lake, recreational buildings, and a shopping centre (to be developed later), the boulevard would connect to Opportunity Lane \u2013 leading into the residential areas of Soul City.\n\nA county-wide high school and bike trails were also planned. Land was set side to grow food. Soul City would have a freight rail spur, new water purification and sewage treatment facilities, and even a fire department.\n\n\u201cYou were going to bring to bear, in a rural area, urban types of interactions and economic opportunities,\u201d recalled Eva Clayton, former executive director of the Soul City Foundation, in 1989, as part of the University of North Carolina\u2019s Documenting the American South project. \u201cYou were going to have houses, you were going to have shops, you were possibly going to have the schools.\u201d\n\nA new, \u201climited purpose\u201d governance structure was also planned as part of the experiment. This new town government would create the infrastructure, but the operation and law-making capabilities would be left to Warren County.\n\nAccording to McKissick Jr: \u201cIt would have been a very liveable, planned community ... something you\u2019d see in many places throughout America \u2013 but which was very unique for Warren County.\u201d\n\nVisionary and bold\n\nThe new President Nixon supported Soul City \u2013 and on closer examination, it\u2019s not hard to see why. The Republican party still courted black voters now and again, and the business-oriented McKissick, a believer in capitalism and free markets, had become more Republican-like.\n\nHe had also grown disenchanted with the traditional civil rights movement, the Black Power movement and the Democratic party. By 1972, he was a full-on member of the Republican party who supported Nixon\u2019s re-election.\n\nOne year after Nixon was returned to power, Soul City \u2013 armed with those $14m loan guarantees that enabled it to raise capital and sell bonds to begin construction \u2013 broke ground in a November 1973 ceremony.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soul City as it looks today, an unfinished memorial to McKissick\u2019s grand urban ambitions. Photograph: James Cheadle/www.unionmag.co.uk\n\n\u201cIt was a very exciting period,\u201d McKissick Jr remembers. \u201cThe governor of the state flew in on a helicopter and spoke.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, it was visionary,\u201d Clayton said in the 1989 interview. \u201cIt was bold.\u201d\n\nGini Richards is one of a team of three filmmakers who are completing a 20-minute documentary on Soul City: \u201cI think a lot of people mentioned the groundbreaking as this wonderful moment because it happened several years into the project,\u201d she says. \u201cUp until that point, it had been such a struggle to get buy-in and funding \u2013 you can\u2019t build it unless you have people; but if you don\u2019t have buildings, nobody is going to come.\u201d\n\nAfter the groundbreaking, Soul City\u2019s first houses went up, along with a water system plant, a health clinic, and the Soultech 1 industrial centre. A few residents from Richmond, Virginia and Newark heeded the call and moved into this revolutionary new development.\n\nConstructed at its main entrance on US Highway 1 and Soul City Boulevard was the \u201cSoul City marquee\u201d \u2013 a 20-ft tall, rectangular concrete monument with the town\u2019s name written in a stylish, rounded 1970s font. \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy with our progress at this stage,\u201d said the elder McKissick in 1973.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of Soul City in 1975. Photograph: US General Accounting Office\n\nHe was tempting fate. Getting the private sector and the necessary homebuyers to come in, sit down and invest was already proving a struggle. Then the project was dealt a heavier blow by the 1974 US oil crisis, which caused the cost of petrol to skyrocket, taking the prices of plastic piping and asphalt with it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d see 200 or 300% increases in costs almost overnight,\u201d McKissick Jr says. \u201cThat meant you might as well throw the projections out of the window.\u201d\n\nAfter the Watergate scandal had pushed Nixon from office in 1974, and with the project\u2019s finances now skewing, the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper accused the elder McKissick of misspending Soul City\u2019s government funding.\n\nThen the state\u2019s US senator Jesse Helms \u2013 a Republican and noted segregationist \u2013 demanded a federal audit of Soul City, bringing the project to a near-standstill. Alleging financial waste and mismanagement, Helms called Soul City \u201can insult to the hard-pressed taxpayers of North Carolina, and the nation\u201d.\n\nThe probe found no wrongdoing, but the delay further weakened the project\u2019s viability. With 30-year home mortgages rising above 10% in 1978, Soul City was to all intents and purposes finished \u2013 despite the arrival in April of that year of Welmetco, a manufacturer of backpacks and duffel bags.\n\nAmid severe criticism that the project wasn\u2019t progressing, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development finally pulled its funding in 1979. The agency took over Soul City\u2019s ownership the following year and auctioned off the town for $1.5m.\n\nMcKissick, who sued the department and later settled, kept a few properties under his control. Throughout the 1980s he continued to push the Soul City concept, even after becoming a judge. He died in 1991 aged 69, and was buried in Soul City.\n\nStory of cities #42: Medell\u00edn escapes grip of drug lord to embrace radical urbanism Read more\n\nMore than 6 million black people left the south in the first two-thirds of the 20th century. They escaped the harsh boot of Jim Crow to find a better life in the north of the country, reshaping everything from art to politics in the process.\n\nIn this century, however, the trend is reversing. It is a phenomenon that would have been unthinkable 50 years ago; black people in their tens of thousands are returning to America\u2019s southern states.\n\nAnd Soul City is still there, unfinished. It\u2019s now part of the city of Manson, North Carolina, with Soultech 1 making up a section of the county\u2019s jail complex. But the streets, the giant Soul City sign, and other reminders of those heady days are still there.\n\nPortions of the area resemble a ghost town, rotting \u2013 or perhaps waiting. Could Soul City ever be resurrected?\n\n\u201cI could see it occurring,\u201d says McKissick Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of whether it\u2019s in this decade or the next, or if it takes longer. If Soul City could all be reassembled, it could have great potential.\u201d\n\n\n\nDoes your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?

Show Hide China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China \u2013 and Chinese goods \u2013 with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century \"silk road\", made up of a \"belt\" of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime \"road\" of shipping lanes. Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects? In Cities of the New Silk Road we have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project's tangible results so far \u2013 from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed \u201cGermany\u2019s China city\u201d. Our correspondents have reported from the \u201cnext Dubai\u201d rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa\u2019s largest port, and more.\n\nNick Van Mead Read more: Cities of the New Silk Road\n\n\n\nAs home to Cambodia\u2019s only deep-water port \u2013 part of a vital trade route for President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road development initiative \u2013 the city has become a focal point for Chinese investment. Vast Chinese-run construction projects are visible across almost every area of the city and its high streets are now lined with majority-Chinese businesses and restaurants. Prime minister Hun Sen\u2019s willing embrace of Chinese investment, unlike neighbouring countries Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam, has ensured Cambodia is at the core of belt and road plans in southeast Asia. The southern coast of Cambodia is now home to $4.2bn worth of power plants and offshore oil operations all owned by Chinese companies. Beyond Sihanoukville, belt and road money is financing a new highway to Phnom Penh and a bigger airport in the capital.\n\nThe Cityscape: get the best of Guardian Cities delivered to you every week, with just-released data, features and on-the-ground reports from all over the world\n\nThe speed of development has left many locals unnerved. Some estimate that the Chinese make up almost 20% of the town\u2019s population. Of the total number of foreign arrivals in 2017, nearly 120,000 were Chinese \u2013 an increase of 126% year-on-year. This fear has fuelled rising hostility among locals towards the new influx of Chinese residents. The two communities live side-by-side in Sihanoukville but rarely interact.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Sihanoukville port has become a vital trade route for the Belt and Road development. Photograph: Pring Samrang/Reuters\n\nSitting outside her family restaurant and guesthouse in Otres beach, 23-year-old Deu Dy gestures with concern to the huge Chinese resort complex being built next door. It has gone up in less than a year, with construction 24 hours a day.\n\n\u201cEverything has changed in Sihanoukville in just two years,\u201d says Dy, who is learning Chinese to try to integrate better with the city\u2019s new community. \u201cBefore it was really quiet here, but not any more with all the Chinese construction. I am worried that it\u2019s very destructive to the environment, all this building \u2026 and what will happen when all the construction is finished and thousands more people come? There will be no Cambodia left in Sihanoukville.\u201d\n\nBefore it was really quiet here, but not any more with all the Chinese construction Deu Dy\n\nLike many local business owners in the city, she is regularly approached by Chinese investors wanting to buy her inn and offering her very good money. It is tempting, now she says that her family\u2019s profits have collapsed: the 24-hour construction next door has driven away their European customers, while Chinese tourists prefer to stay in Chinese-run hotels and resorts.\n\nWhile not directly funded by Belt and Road money, the casinos and condo complexes are a byproduct of a city that has given itself over entirely to Chinese investment. Of the $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) invested in Sihanoukville over the past year, $1.1bn has come from China. Chinese casino owners have also taken advantage of the nonexistent gambling regulation and lax money-laundering laws to set up an empire that is accessible only to foreigners \u2013 because gambling is still illegal for Cambodian locals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An illustration of plans for Kai Bo Plaza in Sihanoukville.\n\nMany of the new Chinese businesspeople arriving in Sihanoukville are here to take advantage of a new China-Cambodia tax-free economic zone. The majority of the 100-plus factories in the zone are run by Chinese companies, and a further 200 mainly Chinese companies \u2013 producing consumer goods and garments \u2013 will be part of its ongoing expansion. A four-lane highway is being built by a Chinese construction company to connect Sihanoukville to Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh.\n\nFollow the New Silk Road Read more\n\nFor the locals, this ongoing transformation is divisive. Some are benefiting from an influx of money the city has never seen before, but many are being driven out by the skyrocketing cost of living.\n\nKong Samol, 32, a tuk-tuk driver, is one of those losing out. \u201cBecause of all the Chinese businessmen here, my expenses have gone up but my earnings have gone down,\u201d he says. \u201cMy rent has increased from $50 to $150 and it\u2019s unaffordable for me. The owner wants to kick me out of my room so he can rent it to the Chinese who will pay so much more than I can afford. I know so many people who came here for work but have moved back to their villages because rent is impossible now.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sihanoukville has changed dramatically in two years.\n\nHemming clothes outside his sewing shop in the shadow of a new Chinese casino, Seng Lim Huon says Chinese investment is widening the divide between rich and poor. \u201cThe people who own the land here and have houses to rent, they can live bigger and bigger because they can earn so much more than before,\u201d he says, adding that rooms he would once rent out for $500 per month to local residents now go for $4,500 to Chinese visitors. \u201cBut for people who don\u2019t own land, it is a terrible situation.\u201d\n\nSvay Sovana, 42, was among those overjoyed by Chinese investment in Sihanoukville. She used to earn $1,000 per month renting out a three-storey house to Europeans; she will earn $15,000 when her new Chinese tenants move in this month.\n\nThe Chinese have much more money than Cambodians, and that means they have the power here now Srey Mach\n\nThe transformation has also brought employment to the city. While a large number of Chinese workers have been brought in to staff casinos, there are also more jobs being offered to Cambodians, who earn between $120 and $200 a month (considered decent wages). Cambodian workers on Chinese construction sites earn three times what they used to on local projects.\n\nMore grandiose and divisive projects are cropping up by the day. This week saw the announcement of a new $1bn joint Chinese-Malaysian-run Sihanoukville resort Wisney World, which will feature water parks, hotels, casinos, malls, gardens and churches across 65 hectares of land. In a sign of the disconnect between Chinese investors and those in local government, Sihanoukville\u2019s provincial governor, Yun Min, said he had never even heard of the project.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chinese investment has brought wealth to the city \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t reached the whole community.\n\nSihanoukville is no stranger to foreign investment. Before the Chinese it was the Russians who pumped money into local resorts and restaurants. The relationship is memorialised by a large, fading billboard outside an abandoned resort building site, which pictures long-serving Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen shaking Vladimir Putin\u2019s hand.\n\nHowever, the key complaint for many in Sihanoukville is that even though Chinese investment brings wealth, it is mainly kept within their own community. Chinese residents and visitors buy from Chinese businesses and visit Chinese restaurants and hotels, ensuring the trickle-down effect is minimal.\n\nI think the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy accepts there is rising anti-China rhetoric in Cambodia Vannarith \u200bChheang\n\n\u201cChinese products are very expensive, it is not good for us, and the Chinese buy only Chinese goods so we are very separate,\u201d says Srey Mach, 43, shredding morning glory outside her shop while the sound of construction thunders all around. \u201cEven the vegetables and fruits they export from China. The Chinese have money, much more money than the Cambodians, and that means they have the power here now.\u201d\n\nAs one of south-east Asia\u2019s poorest countries, suffering from basic power and sanitation issues, Cambodia has welcomed the hefty cheques, soft loans and infrastructure plans from China with open arms. Between 2013 and 2017, China invested $5.3bn in the country \u2013 that\u2019s more money than the Cambodian government did. Cambodia\u2019s reliance on China has become even more pronounced in recent months after the US and EU pulled funding in the light of recent authoritarian political measures.\n\nThe speed at which money is pouring in has also left local authorities in Sihanoukville with little time and resources to create regulation to manage either the dark underbelly of the Chinese casinos \u2013 sophisticated financial crime and money laundering \u2013 or the growing local discontentment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deu Dy outside her family\u2019s guest house in Otres beach.\n\nLocals seethe when they discuss the problem of organised crime: there have been incidents of kidnappings as well as an increase in drink-driving accidents and prostitution. Earlier this year, the regional governor complained that the crime rate in the province was increasing, in part due to an influx of \u201cChinese mafia [who] disguise themselves to commit various crimes and kidnap Chinese investors \u2026 causing insecurity in the province\u201d.\n\nYet with so much at stake in Cambodia, the Chinese are equally keen for the tide not to turn against Belt and Road.

Any student of Mnangagwa\u2019s record knew he had been Mugabe\u2019s enforcer, deeply involved in money laundering and massacres.\n\nBut Stewart could hardly do anything but hold his nose, and point to the opportunities that democratic reform might bring.\n\nZanu-PF 2.0 might seem an implausible concept, but the possibility existed that the ruling party post-Mugabe realised the status quo was not an option. Mugabe had presided over the fastest shrinking economy in peacetime history. Zimbabwe\u2019s GDP per capita is approximately $1,000 (\u00a3765), compared with $6,000 in Botswana. Nearly a fifth of the country had left.\n\nAlthough there was a limit to what the UK could offer \u2013 British sanctions were minimal \u2013 Britain did have influence with private investors and multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the only body that could help lift Zimbabwe\u2019s $13bn debt burden.\n\nBritain also offered a return to the Commonwealth and other international seals of approval, but all depends on the delivery of free and fair elections. These were always going to be the acid test, the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson said. The Zimbabwean government seemed to understand the bargain describing the elections as \u201can instrument of foreign policy\u201d, the route to ending the country\u2019s isolation.\n\nAs a result, these elections were probably the most monitored in African democratic history \u2013 a marked contrast to the previous rigged elections in 2013. In total 43 different sets of external observers were officially invited by the government \u2013 including individual countries, blocs, such as the EU, liberation movements and two eminent individuals: Andrew Young, a former US diplomat, and Jeff Flake, the Republican Arizona senator. More than 6,000 Zimbabweans acted as civil society observers.\n\nThe most important observers were the Southern Africa Development Community, the EU monitoring team led by the German MEP Elmar Brok, the Commonwealth Observers group including the Conservative poll expert Lord Hayward, the 64-strong African Union observers headed by a former prime minister of Ethiopia, and the joint US-based International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute.\n\nThe UK was aware that such an array of observers might lead to a range of judgments about the fairness of the elections and did something to try to share and coordinate observations.\n\nElection monitoring is not a science and requires a lot more than an American senator staring at people peacefully voting.\n\nThe SADC was noticeably more sanguine about the credibility of the result than the EU and US delegations. But the EU did not describe the result as illegal as the Opposition MDC urged it to do.\n\nThe delay in announcing the election result and the overall performance of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission hardly inspire confidence, but short of more egregious ballot stuffing the betting must be that the UK has gone too far with the reform process to pull back now.\n\nFaced with the sight of teargas, protesters shot in the street and the rapid deployment of the army, the new Africa minister Harriett Baldwin has expressed deep concern and called for restraint from all sides.\n\nBut British MPs in Zimbabwe such as Kate Hoey are demanding that the UK embassy specifically condemn the army and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission for delaying the announcement of the presidential results.\n\nThat political pressure is likely to build.

Or dance. Or pretty much do anything really. I can\u2019t write, I can\u2019t paint.\n\n\u201cBut just how it allows your supporters and your community to see you in a different scenario is beneficial. And the more I\u2019m here the more I think: \u2018Yeah, it can transfer.\u2019 But you just have to understand the environment that you are in and how you can do it. It\u2019s not an easy process. You announce to a bunch of guys that on their day off they\u2019re going to be doing dancing practice, they\u2019re not going to say: \u2018That\u2019s fantastic.\u2019 So there are managerial issues that you have to explain, always linking it with football.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Graham Potter moved to south Wales after eight years in Sweden. Photograph: Ashley Crowden/Guardian/Athena Pictures\n\nThe premise behind it all is to develop the depth of a person by taking players and staff out of their comfort zone for wider collective reward. \u201cSometimes there is a disconnect between footballers and supporters, because there are highly-paid people here and supporters over there, and nothing in between,\u201d says Potter. \u201cAnd then when you need the support, when things go bad, there is no reference for them to say: \u2018OK, I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s a week or three weeks, sometimes you need that. And we had that at \u00d6stersund. We had an environment where our home record was fantastic and the support was brilliant. Imagine if you could get that at the Liberty \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re with you no matter what happens\u2019. That\u2019s ultimately what we\u2019re trying to do, to create something where supporters say: \u2018I can relate to you, I know you\u2019re going to do some things that are wrong, but I\u2019m still going to be with you.\u2019\u201d\n\nErudite, modest and gregarious, Potter comes across as such an interesting character. It also seems as though there are so many layers to a man who studied social sciences at university, has a masters degree in leadership and emotional intelligence, made 300 appearances across all four divisions as a player, and won three promotions and the Swedish Cup as a manager.\n\nPlay Video 4:24 The Comfort Zone: the unconventional methods of \u00d6stersund's Graham Potter \u2013 video\n\nHe certainly breaks with a few stereotypes. \u201cI\u2019d read a classics book on the bus when I was at York,\u201d the 43-year-old says, recalling his playing days. \u201cBut I think that was just to wind Jon Parkin up \u2013 \u2018What are you doing with your life?\u2019\u201d\n\nDigital Ronaldos stay strong in bid for eWorld Cup glory Read more\n\nPotter could have been forgiven for asking himself the same when he took over at \u00d6stersund in 2010, yet it proved to be the making of him. For a while it seemed as though his work went unnoticed outside of Sweden \u2013 Potter acknowledges it was not until \u00d6stersund reached the last 32 of the Europa League last season that his profile really changed.\n\nYet he has no qualms about that or the fact that it took so long to receive a decent job offer here. \u201cI was never waking up and thinking: \u2018How do I get back to the UK? How do I get to the Premier League?\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nBut did he not deserve a chance earlier? \u201cI think you always have to put yourself in a position where the risk for the person employing you is less,\u201d Potter adds. \u201cFor example, I would not have got a Conference North job [in 2010]. I was at Leeds Carnegie, the ninth tier. And I was coaching students. There would have been hundreds of managers with more experience. So I had to go to the fourth tier of Swedish football, pretty much in the Arctic circle.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Graham Potter, then head coach of Oestersunds FK, celebrates after a victory during the Europa League last season.

Identity has been lost, there\u2019s no sort of trust, confidence is low and responsibility has been passed because of decision-making at a different level.\u201d\n\nNumber of clubs sponsored by betting firms is \u2018disturbing\u2019, say campaigners Read more\n\nOn top of that, Swansea\u2019s squad lacks depth and quality. \u201cI think it\u2019s 13 players that have already left and there is speculation that maybe more might leave,\u201d Potter says. \u201c[Leroy] Fer, [Sam] Clucas and [Wilfried] Bony aren\u2019t available [through injury]. And we\u2019ve signed three players for around \u00a36m, so you don\u2019t have to be a genius \u2013 there is obviously a restructure and a transitional period.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nPotter radiates positivity and describes the slow arrival of new faces as \u201cpart of the challenge\u201d rather than a source of frustration. At the same time, he clearly wants to add to Joel Asoro, Bersant Celina and Barrie McKay, all of whom are young and hungry and part of a new transfer strategy that Potter is driving with Kyle Macaulay, the head of recruitment who followed him from \u00d6stersund. \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased with the ones we\u2019ve got. And we need to do more,\u201d he says.\n\nThere will be no quick fix for Swansea, who start their season at Sheffield United on Saturday, but that is all part of the appeal for Potter. \u201cI\u2019ve always been attracted to something that is about building and creating,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve moved my family from an idyllic life in Sweden, so I didn\u2019t come back just for a job.

It\u2019s only when you see the words Bus \u00c9ireann on the stop on the far side of the bridge that you get any inkling that you have left the United Kingdom and are now in the Irish Republic.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I took a road trip around the British Isles. We went from London up to southwest Scotland, then on through Northern Ireland \u2013 via Derry and Strabane \u2013 to County Sligo, before returning via Dublin and Holyhead and home through north Wales. We took in five countries in six days, crossed five borders, and I never once had to show my passport at any of them. I hadn\u2019t expected to do so. But for how much longer will this be so?\n\nScotland's Brexit bill is 'perfectly practical', supreme court told Read more\n\nThough the countries of these islands are very different in many ways, and all are assertive about their identities, we are all used to the boundaries between them being more cultural than political. Only Scotland had even erected a road sign that announced that here was a different place from the one we had just been. The others simply merged into one another. I increasingly came to suspect that this is because, in spite of their differences and their histories, all five countries of these islands still have at least as much in common as they do that separates and divides them.\n\nWill this survive? The United Kingdom is not as united as it was in my boyhood. Scotland hovers constantly on the threshold of separatism. Brexit has thrown Irish politics into uncertainty. Labour-majority Wales chafes at dependence on the Tory government in London. Meanwhile, England has pulled up the mental drawbridge against Europe without giving a moment\u2019s thought to the dire effects on Ireland, Scotland or Wales. Yet it remains true that we are bound together in deep and extraordinary ways.\n\nOne is the language. Travelling to WB Yeats country on the Irish west coast, reading Roy Foster\u2019s biography of the poet as I did, then stopping at the National Famine Museum at Strokestown, the Anglo-Irish dimension loomed very large. But I have never been more conscious, in Ireland and in Wales, of how pathetically little effort English people like me make to understand or speak a few words of the local languages. An ice-cream seller at the foot of Snowdon said to me once: \u201cIf you were in Italy, you\u2019d try to ask me in Italian, so in Wales why don\u2019t you try to ask in Welsh?\u201d He was right.\n\nYet the Irish Republic really is a different country. Men and women have fought, died and suffered for it to be so. Any suggestion from an Englishman that we share a single geographic or social space with Ireland can still provoke accusations of colonialist sympathies. I once wrote a Guardian editorial about the BBC weather forecast in which I gently suggested that Dublin might perhaps be usefully identified on the weather map. In response, some letter-writers made it very clear that, after a thousand years of oppression, Ireland\u2019s weather was none of the Guardian\u2019s damned business.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Constance Markiewicz, the first elected woman MP in the UK. Photograph: Walshe/Getty Images\n\nBut these islands are our shared business, or they should be. In Sligo, as the Yeats summer school gathered next door to discuss Yeats and Asia, the woman in the tourist office asked me: \u201cDo you know who Constance Markiewicz was?\u201d I certainly did, but it was striking that she asked. The woman born Constance Gore-Booth in a landed Anglo-Irish family in 1868, whose home was up the road from Sligo, would become Britain\u2019s first elected female MP (though as a Sinn F\u00e9iner she never took her seat), and later, Ireland\u2019s \u2013 and the world\u2019s \u2013 first female cabinet minister.\n\nDoes Theresa May know who Markiewicz was? I have no idea. May was in Belfast the day before I arrived there. She said, as she always does, how precious the union with the north is to her. Yet her view of the union is as rigid as a flagpole. It is a home counties English Conservative view that has little feel for the human and cultural suppleness of the UK union, or of the European one either. She gives no inkling that she possesses the emotional or imaginative space for the complexity of these islands or their history. You would never know from her Belfast speech that Northern Ireland voted 56%-44% against Brexit, let alone that support for remain in Northern Ireland has risen to over 70% in a recent poll \u2013 still less that her government is propped up by the DUP, which she never mentioned.\n\nDo not mistake shared institutions for shared and supple mentalities. That was one lesson I learned on this drive. In Kirkcudbright, a nice town in Scotland, it was Scottish night as we arrived, and a bagpipe band straight out of a tourist brochure marched through the town as dusk fell. But the children who paraded with flags before the pipes arrived had Union Jacks as well as saltires, along with all the flags of Europe and beyond. The following evening, hundreds of people on horses \u201crode the marches\u201d \u2013 a form of horseback pub crawl to commemorate the town\u2019s burgh status \u2013 but all wearing the countryside riding kit you would see in Wiltshire.\n\nTo break the Irish backstop deadlock, May needs her biggest fudge yet | Marley Morris Read more\n\nReturning across the Irish Sea to Holyhead, we detoured south to Llanystumdwy in north Wales to visit the grave and museum dedicated to David Lloyd George. Britain has never had a prime minister who more confidently combined the particular with the shared identities on which these islands rest, nor one who believed so firmly, or so early, in the devolutionary \u201chome rule all round\u201d approach that the Liberals came so close to embracing in 1912. Nor one who spoke two British languages fluently and with such brilliance. Nor one who had more feel for the islands\u2019 personalities. And yet, Lloyd George\u2019s feel never extended to Ireland, which he only visited once and of whose modern divisions he is one of the prime authors.\n\nAt the risk of employing national stereotypes, all the UK countries have much to learn from the Irish Republic, which seems in many ways to be more at ease with itself than Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England \u2013 England above all. If even Lloyd George, with his enormous leadership talents, failed to keep these islands together at a time of crisis, when Ireland revolted during and after the first world war, it is difficult to imagine that May, who is much less gifted, can do so. All I know is that the solution, if there is one, lies in mutual respect, historical humility, and an open and curious mind about the extraordinary part of Europe we all inhabit.\n\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist", "sentiment": 0.005655555555555549, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "England must start to listen to its neighbours on these troubled isles | Martin Kettle"}, {"published": "2017-02-16T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/16/taste-air-pollution-smog-your-stories-life-polluted-cities", "text": "Readers shared their experiences of living in cities affected by air pollution \u2013 from the curse of the \u2018Delhi chest\u2019 in India\u2019s capital to celebrating blue sky in Shanghai\n\n'You can taste it in the air': your stories of life in polluted cities\n\n'You can taste it in the air': your stories of life in polluted cities\n\nEUROPE\n\nWarsaw, Poland\n\n\u201cThe air pollution problem in Poland is beyond any western standards.

Each runs to exactly 100 words with the opening and closing three words repeated.\n\n\n\nLest We Forget? review \u2013 deeply moving memorials to the Great War dead Read more\n\nIn collaboration with the Imperial War Museums, the centenas will be published on the First World War Centenary Partnership website one at a time from Sunday.\n\n\n\nThe stories of a diverse collection of individuals from Mahatma Gandhi and Elsie Inglis, founder of the Scottish Women\u2019s Hospitals, to Karl Kraus, a Jewish Austrian satirist and Jeanne De-Neve, a Belgian refugee needle worker, aim to reflect experiences of the conflict around the world.\n\n\n\nThe subjects also include soldiers on the western front, attendants on the hospital ships, nurses protecting patients as bombs fall, wives, husbands, parents and siblings all coping with loss, refugees fleeing their homes and, sometimes, finding hope elsewhere.\n\nThe Belfast-based poet Therese Kieran chose the Belgian embroiderer De-Neve, who fled Mechelen with her family and ended up a refugee with her two sisters in Monaghan, Ireland, where they set up a sewing business. They were among up to 250,000 Belgian refugees to flee to the UK and Ireland.\n\n\u201cThese three sisters could sew and embroider. Jeanne De-Neve was the eldest and very entrepreneurial, and she immediately got business cards printed in 1914,\u201d said Kieran. They sought work from the \u201cbig houses\u201d belonging to landowners, who needed embroidery and lacework.\n\n\n\nThe sisters, appalled at the poverty they found in Ireland, began teaching local women, \u201cgoing around in a horse and cart to farms where a lot of the men were out of work, or were serving. They knew this would help women generate an income.\u201d They helped establish a lingerie and undergarment factory in Monaghan \u2013 Bel-Broid \u2013 which Jeanne continued to visit long after she returned to Belgium.\n\n\n\nKieran said: \u201cThe refugee story inspired me. These people came to the UK at a time people were poor. Yet we accommodated them. These Belgians were proud. Those women taught embroidery and sewed. Other refugees did carpentry, or taught French. Their skills were quickly discovered and employed. And, I just think, what a contrast to what we are hearing today. That gripped me.\u201d\n\n\n\nLisa Andrews, a Surrey-based freelance writer and editor, chose her great-grandfather Horace Reginald Sumner, a religious man, believed to have been a pacifist, who worked on the hospital ships as part of the Royal Navy\u2019s Sick Berth Reserves.\n\n\n\nAndrews never knew him. But a family story passed down generations told how he once prevented somebody on a hospital ship taking their own life. \u201cSo I chose this moment, inspired by him, but seen through the eyes of someone who must have been in a desperate situation,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do know Horace was on the HM Hospital Ship Plassey, which responded to the Battle of Jutland. So Horace would have seen some pretty shocking injuries.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf the centenas, which are also to be published in a crowdfunded book, with the profits going to charity, she added: \u201cThey reflect a generation that is no longer with us \u2013 many of whom felt unable to speak of what they saw, or died before they even had the chance.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a power in the constraint of short-form writing. One hundred words is not very much. But, actually, you can say so much in 100 words. All of our writers have done that. Some of them will absolutely break your heart.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohn Simmons, 26 Characters Ltd founder director, said it was the biggest, most ambitious project in the group\u2019s 15-year-history. \u201cIt\u2019s the most moving collection of 100-word stories, each written as a new form, the centena, that provide a memorial to the past and through the act of remembrance gives hope for the future.\u201d\n\nStitches in Time\n\nBy Therese Kieran\n\nA needle\u2019s eye threw her a lifeline:\n\nbetween finger & thumb\n\nshe pinched silver to make a little gold,\n\ntold her story via business card:\n\nJEANNE DE-NEVE & SISTERS,\n\nBelgian Embroiders, (late of Maline)\n\nto Ireland\u2019s muddy hem, she trailed a running stitch:\n\neach stitch a step from Mechelen to Monaghan\n\neach stitch a suture mending hearts of women, of men.\n\nShe knew the good of soft tarantulle on skin\n\ntrained local women,\n\nhelped Bel-Broid spread its wings,\n\nclung to kith & kin:\n\nrefugees, she never knew they\u2019d be,\n\ntheir French knots undone, in history-making\n\nsteely, through a needle\u2019s eye.\n\nInspired by Jeanne De-Neve\n\n\n\n\n\nIn service of humanity\n\nBy Lisa Andrews\n\nsays his name is sumner and that life is sacred\n\nbut tell that to the fishes and the higher-ups\n\nsince this husk is a tatter of nerves and a glister of scars\n\nsays his name and it is a bugle-bright call to arms\n\nthat I cannot answer with his too-fresh skin\n\nand his old-as-Methuselah eyes\n\nsays his name and it sounds like summer\n\nand for a moment the stink of blistering flesh is swept away\n\nby the sweet tang of newly-mown grass\n\nit is a smell worth fighting for\n\nbut the question is am I?\n\nso I says his name.\n\nInspired by Horace Reginald Sumner", "sentiment": -0.008728205128205149, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "100 days, 100 lives: pen portraits to mark Armistice centenary"}, {"published": "2016-09-29T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/29/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-inquiry-foreign-property-ownership", "text": "Exclusive Sadiq Khan tells the Guardian he will carry out \u2018the most thorough research on this matter ever undertaken\u2019 amid widespread concern over rising housing costs and gentrification\n\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan is to launch the UK\u2019s most comprehensive inquiry into the impact of foreign investment flooding London\u2019s housing market, amid growing fears about the scale of gentrification and rising housing costs in the capital.\n\n\n\nKhan said there are \u201creal concerns\u201d about the surge in the number of homes being bought by overseas investors, adding that the inquiry would map the scale of the problem for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to better understand the different roles that overseas money plays in London\u2019s housing market, the scale of what\u2019s going on, and what action we can take to support development and help Londoners find a home,\u201d Khan told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are commissioning the most thorough research on this matter ever undertaken in Britain \u2013 the biggest look of its kind at this issue \u2013 so we can figure out exactly what can be done.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian revealed how a 50-storey block of 214 luxury apartments by the river Thames in Vauxhall was more than 60% owned by foreign buyers. In one of the starkest examples of the impact of foreign investment, it found that a quarter of the flats were held by companies in secretive offshore tax havens, and many were unoccupied.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Tower, a 50-storey apartment complex in Vauxhall, is more than 60% foreign-owned. Photograph: Alamy\n\nIn China, experts predict the current scale of global investment in UK property could rise significantly over the next decade, with a \u201cnew wave\u201d of middle-class investors from mainland China quadrupling the amount of money flowing annually into foreign real estate \u2013 including the UK \u2013 to $200bn (\u00a3150bn) in the next 10 years.\n\nCharles Pittar, chief executive of Juwai.com, a website that aims to pair Chinese investors with property developers overseas, said he expected a major jump in investors looking for a return in Britain, adding: \u201cThe UK market, particularly post-Brexit, is really picking up.\n\n\u201cOur thesis \u2013 and this is supported by quite a lot of evidence \u2013 is that in many ways the international Chinese investment journey is probably just starting \u2026 The exciting thing about China is that there are 168 cities with more than a million people. So this is just such a huge market.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat view is supported by Victor Li, a director of international project marketing for the US real estate giant CBRE, who also predicts a spike in investment in British homes over the next decade.\n\n\u201cI think it is just beginning,\u201d said Li, predicting that only 3% of the potential investors in overseas property had so far been located across mainland China: \u201cIt is a big market, and they are getting wealthier and wealthier.\u201d\n\nCritics say the influx of foreign investors is contributing to a spiralling housing crisis in the capital. Earlier this week, it emerged that the number of thirtysomethings leaving London has leapt in recent years, as high housing costs have forced people to move out.\n\nOverseas buyers are also increasingly focusing on towns and cities outside the UK capital \u2013 with Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham all identified as \u201chotspots\u201d as buyers try to get more for their money while avoiding new stamp duty rules. Property in London\u2019s outer suburbs and even satellite towns such as Slough is being marketed in Hong Kong to potential Chinese buyers.\n\nForeign investment has helped drive a fresh property building boom around the UK. Liverpool has received millions of pounds of overseas investment in housing and property in the past five years, including a \u00a3200m New Chinatown development that is under construction and is being heavily marketed in China. Earlier this year, Sheffield announced a multibillion pound deal with a Chinese construction firm that would generate four or five city-centre projects over the next three years and create \u201chundreds if not thousands\u201d of jobs in south Yorkshire.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese are the biggest buyers of new-build residential accommodation globally, with the Singaporeans second and the British fourth, according to international property agents Knight Frank.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artist\u2019s impression of the \u00a3200m New Chinatown development in Liverpool. Illustration: BLOK Architecture\n\nKhan\u2019s inquiry will focus on the scale and impact of different types of overseas investment in London. It will examine how foreign cash has changed the housing market \u2013 from exclusive high-cost accommodation to middle- and low-cost homes \u2013 in different parts of London, and explore how other international cities are tackling the problem.\n\n\n\nKhan said: \u201cWe welcome investment from around the world in building new homes, including those for first-time buyers. At the same time, as more and more Londoners struggle to get on the property ladder, there are real concerns about the prospect of a surge in the number of homes being bought by overseas investors.\u201d\n\nOne key aim of the research will be shining a light on who is investing and where the money originates from.\n\nKhan said: \u201cWe urgently need more transparency around overseas money invested in London property. Londoners need reassuring that dirty money isn\u2019t flooding into our property market, and ministers must now make all property ownership in London transparent so we can see exactly who owns what.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut some housing market commentators warn it would be a mistake to focus only on foreign investment when tackling London\u2019s housing crisis. Yolande Barnes, director of Savills\u2019 world research department, said foreign buyers accounted for only 7% of property purchased across Greater London, although that figure is likely to be higher in inner-London hotspots. And she said that investment had helped bring forward nearly all the \u201caffordable homes\u201d built in London since the 2008 financial downturn.\n\n\u201cForeign buyers are often the focus in discussions about the housing crisis, but really they are only one element in an incredibly complicated picture. Without them investing in properties at the top end, we would not have been able to fund very much social or affordable housing since the financial crash.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarnes said the real issue was the price and scarcity of land available for development in the capital.\n\n\u201cLike any major world city, the issue in London centres around the fact that there is not enough of the most popular bits of the city to go around. Inner London land rarely comes on to the market, and it only makes sense for people to release land and turn it into residential units if they are going to get a suitable return \u2013 which normally means high-end luxury developments.\u201d\n\nGentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution Read more\n\nHowever, a recent study by academics at London\u2019s Goldsmiths University found that the influx of cash into the capital\u2019s luxury housing market from the global super-rich was having a wider impact on gentrification across the city.\n\nIt discovered that foreign investment at the top end had pushed London\u2019s \u201ctraditional elite\u201d residents from their wealthy enclaves in places such as Mayfair, Chelsea and Hampstead, and created a \u201ctrickle down\u201d effect \u2013 raising prices beyond the reach of most people in previously cheaper London neighbourhoods.\n\nAre you experiencing or resisting gentrification in your city?

Now allergic to the entire spectrum of light, Kapellas has spent the past decade living in complete darkness.\n\nWhen one of the side effects of the drugs Kapellas was prescribed made him \u201cgo nuts\u201d, he started drawing gigantic abstract pictures on his wall and playing the piano to calm his mind and soothe his pain. How to Make a Pearl explores Kapellas\u2019s coping mechanisms and how he is turning the \u201cgrit\u201d of past trauma into a \u201cpearl\u201d of reflective creativity.\n\nAlthough Kapellas has spent more than 10 years living in literal darkness, he\u2019s unfettered by the limitations his environment would seem to impose. His social interactions are sporadic and his world has shrunk to the interior of his home, but he finds fulfilment and enlightenment in the everyday.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time in his life that Kapellas has had to navigate the pain and joy of being alive. He witnessed domestic abuse as a small child, is a Vietnam veteran, navigated a divorce, and lost a considerable amount of gay friends and lovers to the HIV/Aids epidemic. And yet the way he lives his unlit life shows an uncanny ability to look back at his past with fondness and the future with hope.\n\nPlay Video 22:02 How To Make a Pearl\n\nThe making of How to Make a Pearl\n\nThree years ago director Jason Hanasik\u2019s best friend escorted him down the dimly lit hallway of a grand San Francisco apartment building. At the end of the hall, a faint circle of light was waiting for them; as they approached, the circle disappeared into a pitch-black room. Ahead of him, the man with the flashlight called out: \u201cJason, I\u2019ve heard so much about you. It\u2019s nice to finally meet.\u201d\n\nThe man controlling the faint circle of light was Kapellas, the subject of How to Make a Pearl.\n\n\n\nFor the past 10 years, Kapellas, now 64 years old, has had to live by short bursts of light from a one or two-battery flashlight. Not only can Kapellas not be in sunlight or moonlight but he also can\u2019t be in the light from his computer, his phone or the lamps that he gave away a long time ago. Kapellas\u2019s extreme immune responses can last from hours to days. Doctors have no idea what causes his condition and, while they\u2019ve found medications to alleviate some of his pain, he has no idea if he\u2019ll ever leave what he calls his cave or his tomb.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Documentary maker Jason Hanasik. Photograph: Jason Hanasik\n\nWhen Hanasik\u2019s toes finally touched the edge of the circle of light Kapellas was projecting, he could feel a person\u2019s presence on the other side of it but still couldn\u2019t see them. His eyes had yet to adjust but as he approached, Kapellas grabbed him from the darkness for a hug. As their bodies pressed together, the light swung slightly upward and for the first time, Hanasik could see Kapellas\u2019s searching eyes and kind smile.\n\n\u201cHi John, it\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d Hanasik said.\n\nKapellas led him into what he would come to know as Kapellas\u2019s living room. Over the next hour, Hanasik adjusted to the darkness and he and Kapellas talked about their lives, anxieties and Kapellas\u2019s experience of living in the dark.\n\nWhile there was something special about Kapellas, Hanasik didn\u2019t leave his world thinking he\u2019d make a film about him. He didn\u2019t want to make a film that was only about the dark or Kapellas\u2019s condition. Since we don\u2019t know why Kapellas\u2019s body decided to react to light, the film spends its time on who Kapellas is and how he has come to terms with this part of his life.\n\nFor more on the film, read Kapellas\u2019s article for Weekend magazine and listen to our new Doc Tales podcast about the making of the film.\n\nComing up: White Fright\n\n\n\nIn April 2015, Robert Doggart was arrested for plotting what would have been the deadliest terror attack on US soil since 9/11, in Islamberg, New York.

British documentary legend Molly Dineen returns with her first film in 10 years, Being Blacker, an intimate portrait of Jamaican-born reggae producer, businessman, father, son and community pillar Blacker Dread. After a limited number of preview screenings, it will also be shown on British TV.\n\nAcross the UK, there are screenings in March of Bombshell: The Hedy Lamaar Story, including a satellite Q&A screening in Sheffield. An inventor and Hollywood star, she has only been remembered for the latter. This documentary changes that, with never-before-heard audio tapes of Lamaar speaking on the record about her incredible life.\n\nWe also recommend the brilliant Erase and Forget, Andrea Luka Zimmerman\u2019s kaleidoscopic film about Bo Gritz, one of America\u2019s most highly decorated Vietnam veterans, who has been called the inspiration for Rambo. It screens this evening, Friday 2 March, at Home Manchester and then tours the UK.\n\nThe Glasgow film festival has a great selection of documentaries in its Stranger than Fiction strand, plus two special screenings outside this strand.

I mean, apart from the rush to book them on said airwaves? By now, you will be aware that English Defence League founder and tanning salonista Tommy Robinson was freed from prison this week, after the court of appeal judged that one of his contempt of court rulings was flawed, and ordered that he be retrialled on the charge.\n\nLet me tell you something: when the Stone Island Roderick Spode walks out of HMP Onley with his personal effects in three black holdalls, there is a hell of a lot of reflected stardust to play for. And out they all came: Katie Hopkins; Hopkins\u2019s Canadian organ grinder; former Farage spokesprick Raheem Kassam (now at Breitbart); current Ukip leader/pub quiz question Gerard Batten, as well as any number of international arses keen to personally associate themselves with a man who Steve Bannon recently anointed as \u201cthe backbone of this country\u201d, and who Donald Trump Jr recently supported. (\u201cI\u2019d have done six months just for that recognition,\u201d Robinson reportedly said.) There was pointed silence from Nigel Farage \u2013 but we\u2019ll come to that later.\n\nEach jockeyed to give the sense of most familiarity with someone even the BBC\u2019s home affairs correspondent repeatedly referred to simply as \u201cTommy\u201d, as though he were Cher or Madonna, and not a criminal in fact called Stephen. Anyway, there was Ezra Levant, whose rightwing Canadian media firm used to employ Robinson and now employs Hopkins, who boasted that he\u2019d been in the inner sanctum, and \u201cspent time with Tommy Robinson and his beautiful family\u201d. He capped his day with a BBC interview with Eddie Mair during which he repeatedly produced the word \u201cimpute\u201d, though not in a way which imputed to himself even a basic understanding of UK law.\n\nThen there was dear old Abu Hopkins herself, who could certainly use a coattail to cling on to these days, and was perhaps seeking to position herself as the Winnie Mandela to Robinson\u2019s Nelson. \u201cDid they starve him in HMP Onley too?\u201d she fretted in response to the video of Robinson walking out of prison. \u201cLord, he looks thin.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, it was notable how many of Robinson\u2019s high-profile supporters \u2013 even extreme fattists such as Hopkins \u2013 affected agonised concern about his weight. And yet, his BMI seemed to me \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 rather healthier for a man of his stature than what he\u2019d carried in a few months ago. But, as indicated, this was not a view shared by the likes of Mike Cernovich (he of the Pizzagate conspiracy). Cernovich judged that \u201cthe UK government starved him\u201d, and immediately called for the trial of British diplomats in the US \u201cas criminals who put political prisoners into concentration camps\u201d. He later appeared to change his mind and demanded instead the expulsion of the British embassy from the US, as well as \u201cregime change\u201d in the UK.\n\nThe Eurotrash far right, meanwhile, were represented by Geert Wilders, who tweeted: \u201cTommy a free man again. Resistance works. Lots of respect for @RaheemKassam and @ezralevant for all their effort and fantastic work.\u201d\n\nAnd so to Kassam, who appeared on the Today programme and honked all kinds of nonsense without a grown-up expert having been booked to counter him. Given the frequency with which climate scientists and so on are required to argue against denialists \u201cfor balance\u201d, it does seem slightly eccentric to allow Kassam on without a law expert to counter his misapprehensions \u2013 a situation which permitted him to present himself as tenuously coherent, when the reality is something else.\n\nForgive the legal technicalese, but Kassam is just a nebbishy shitposter. He is chiefly known for trailing round after Farage in the classic Farage costume \u2013 the classic being the covert coat, made of tan stuff with a dark-brown velvet collar. I mentioned this in passing once before, and Raheem took the trouble to get in touch to explain hotly that he\u2019d bought his coat before Nigel had bought his. Please do adjust your timelines accordingly.\n\nAnyway, watching the clusterfuck unfold over the course of a news cycle raised two clear questions. 1) Just how big of a narcissistic shit is Tommy Robinson? And 2) Are hitherto relatively disparate elements on the far right coalescing into something more cohesive? We\u2019ll look at the second one in a bit.\n\nThe answer to the first can be dealt with fairly swiftly. For clarity, Robinson is the sort of man who made sure a camera was on hand to record what you might think would have been the day\u2019s most intensely private moment \u2013 his reunification with two of his young children \u2013 and promptly put the footage online. This is the EDL version of flogging your wedding to OK! magazine, and should be judged accordingly. I\u2019m joking, of course \u2013 it\u2019s so much worse. If you watch the video, you will see that Robinson\u2019s son, notably, is in absolutely desperate floods of tears, and the thought of someone carefully keeping the camera trained on it all, packaging it, in order that the emotion might be immediately politicised is a helpful reminder of what you\u2019re dealing with. Not helpful for the child, you understand. But helpful nonetheless.\n\nSensing his priorities, Robinson decided that his public demanded a series of videos, which he obligingly filmed, casting himself yet again as a political prisoner and free-speech martyr. \u201cWhat they tried to do was to mentally destroy me,\u201d he quavered in one. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a prison sentence, that was mental torture.\u201d To which the only response is: well, you shouldn\u2019t keep nearly causing mistrials of child rapists then, should you? Once may be regarded as unfortunate; twice is a thug\u2019s strategy to subvert justice.\n\nAlas, Robinson declined to put this most recent stretch in perspective by saying whether he had felt the same sense of mental torture a few years ago, during the nine months of an 18-month sentence he served for a hefty mortgage fraud \u2013 or, indeed, whether he would have suffered mental torture if he\u2019d got some custodial for the attack on his partner, during which an off-duty police officer who tried to intervene was injured.\n\nAnd so to the sense that some of the currents on the far right are joining up more formally. Certainly, Kassam\u2019s Today blustering saw him trying to convey a closeness with \u201cSteve\u201d (Bannon), declaring \u201cwe are going to build a legitimate, a serious, organisation that is doing things legally and above board that will help unite what we think of as patriotic parties across the continent\u201d. Yet as an excellent article by Cas Mudde made clear this week, Bannon\u2019s reach is overrated. \u201cIn short,\u201d Mudde explained, \u201cBannon is bandwagonning successful European leaders on the radical right in the hope of regaining political relevance.\u201d\n\nAs for the other angles, some detect the hand of Farage in facilitating Bannon\u2019s much-reported recent discussions with the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, Farage being not quite the Westminster outsider-pariah he styles himself as. But the Bannon love is not shared among Farage\u2019s allies. Some time ago, a froideur developed between Arron Banks and Farage over the latter\u2019s closeness to Bannon, with Banks feeling that Bannon was Not A Good Thing At All.\n\nEven so, fuelled by the government\u2019s disastrous handling of basically everything since the Brexit vote two years ago, all manner of rightwingers and far rightwingers are now on manoeuvres. On Talk Radio, Ukip\u2019s Gerard Batten was declaring, \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Tommy, but I think it might be similar to what I\u2019m trying to do, maybe in a less flamboyant way.\u201d Flamboyant! I like how Gerard sees Tommy as the Liberace of the far right \u2013 but he is surely deluded if he thinks he\u2019s on anything other than borrowed time with the Ukip job, a glorified bogseat warmer for Farage.\n\nFarage is simply deciding on the timing of his return to UK politics, which is now surely inevitable (as, indeed, it was about halfway through the last resignation speech of his I attended). It seems likely that he would seek to repurpose Ukip, which has slightly come back in the polls. Which is to say, it\u2019s not literally flatlining any more \u2013 but it crucially retains an electoral machine which took a long time to build up, as such things do, and into which a new movement could be reversed.\n\nBut not a movement in which Tommy Robinson would feature. Robinson is anathema to Farage, who was very studiously silent on his release. Aside from the fact he will have spent Wednesday furious at the attention Robinson was getting, part of Farage\u2019s personal mythology has always been that it is his personage, his leadership that kept such thuggish elements at bay. Quite how Farage and Robinson will fight it out in these ominous times remains to be seen. But for the rest of us, it\u2019s fair to say the only thing worse than one dark star rising again, is two.", "sentiment": 0.02570166666666667, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "The dark stars of the far right compete to bask in the glory of Tommy Robinson"}, {"published": "2017-07-24T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/pseudo-public-space-explore-data-what-missing", "text": "Guardian Cities and Greenspace Information for Greater London CIC (GiGL) have created the first comprehensive map of pseudo-public spaces in the UK capital.

Pseudo-public spaces are large squares, parks and thoroughfares that appear to be public but are actually owned and controlled by developers and corporations. They are on the rise in London and many other British cities, as local authorities argue they cannot afford to create or maintain such spaces themselves.\n\nWhat access do members of the public have?\n\nAlthough they are seemingly accessible to members of the public and have the look and feel of public land, these sites \u2013 also known as privately owned public spaces or \u201cPops\u201d \u2013 are not subject to ordinary local authority bylaws but rather governed by restrictions drawn up the landowner and usually enforced by private security companies. What rules govern them? Under existing laws, public access to pseudo-public spaces remains at the discretion of landowners who are allowed to draw up their own rules for \u201cacceptable behaviour\u201d on their sites and alter them at will. They are not obliged to make these rules public.\n\nThey include major areas of open land around Paddington Station (encompassing both Merchant Square and Paddington Central), nearly seven acres of open space owned by Arsenal Football Club in Islington, busy shopping and dining plazas in Covent Garden and Victoria, and the pseudo-public area around one of London\u2019s most iconic attractions, the London Eye.\n\nThe dataset behind the map has been made public, and can be accessed on the GiGL website. You can see the full list in the table below.\n\nThis is the first comprehensive map of pseudo-public spaces in London, and we\u2019re looking for your help to make it better.\n\nJulie Cox, partnership manager at GiGL, says the organisation is keen to hear of any omissions and inconsistencies in the map as it plans to update and expand this dataset in future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019d definitely like to keep updating as part of the suite of datasets we are responsible for, and ideally something members of the public can contribute to as well,\u201d says Cox.\n\nYou can help us keep the map up to date with land ownership changes in London by contributing information on both new and existing sites with the form below.

Photograph: Nick Ball\u00f3n for the Guardian\n\nPerimenopause \u2013 also known as the menopause transition \u2013 is experienced by millions of women every year. The months or years leading up to the menopause can have very similar symptoms to the menopause itself, although some of these symptoms may change or disappear over time.\n\n\u201cThe most common symptoms are hot flushes and night sweats, but there are also other symptoms that are less thought about,\u201d explains Dr Louise Newson, who specialises in treating women going through the perimenopause and menopause. \u201cMigraines, palpitations, memory problems, low mood, anxiety, joint pain, muscle stiffness, poor sleep, reduced libido,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe hope is that the Grace will help more women feel they can talk openly about menopause\n\nIt\u2019s the more obscure symptoms \u2013 migraines, low mood, tiredness \u2013 that many women fail to identify as part of perimenopause, something Newson partly puts down to the \u201cbig taboo\u201d of the menopause itself.\n\n\u201cThe perimenopause sort of creeps up \u2013 we\u2019re not taught about it at school, or even at medical school,\u201d she says. \u201cLife is busy for lots of women \u2013 if you haven\u2019t got the relevant knowledge, or [if] you\u2019re not aware of the symptoms, you might just think you\u2019re stressed.\u201d\n\nThis lack of knowledge can have a severe impact. Not realising that symptoms are part of a bigger picture, many women fail to seek appropriate treatment. Newson cites examples of patients who falsely believe their memory loss is due to dementia, or who are incorrectly prescribed high doses of antidepressants by doctors who haven\u2019t taken hormonal changes into account.\n\nBut there may be other options. The Perimenopause Challenge is a category in the AXA Health Tech & You Awards that aims to find technologies that can help women track the symptoms of perimenopause \u2013 enabling them to get better support and information. The Grace Wristband, developed by designer Peter Astbury and 2018 winner of the category, operates by easing one of the worst symptoms of the perimenopause \u2013 hot flushes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Grace wristband. Photograph: Nick Ball\u00f3n for the Guardian\n\nAt the onset of a hot flush, says Astbury, the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) is falsely triggered. The Grace Wristband contains a set of sensors that detect this reaction, activating a \u201ccooling tile\u201d that delivers \u201cintense cooling to the wrist\u201d. The goal is to \u201cuse this sensation to signal to the hypothalamus that the body should retain heat\u201d \u2013 a response directly opposite to a hot flush.\n\nThis could, says Astbury, prevent women from waking up in the night with hot flushes, alleviating many of the sleep-related issues faced during perimenopause.\n\nAstbury describes one woman going through perimenopause who, waking up sweating 15 or 20 times a night, would get up and run her wrists under cold water to cool down. \u201cI realised at that point that creating a product that could deal with night sweats was just as important as helping with hot flushes during the day,\u201d he says.\n\nAstbury started developing Grace when he was just 22 and attending Loughborough University \u2013 a time when, perhaps unsurprisingly, he knew \u201cnext to nothing about menopause\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an idea as a designer,\u201d he says, \u201cyou normally do a quick Google search \u2013 99% of the time, it already exists. But in this case, the more I researched, the more I realised that an effective, non-invasive solution for symptoms like hot flushes had still not been created.\u201d\n\nDuring his research, Astbury heard stories from many women \u2013 and it was these that left the biggest impression. \u201cI regularly receive messages from women desperate to be involved as research participants so they can use Grace as soon as possible,\u201d he says.\n\nAs Newson \u2013 who was one of the judges for the Perimenopause Challenge category \u2013 points out, women\u2019s health issues are not always discussed in an open or comfortable way; something Astbury hopes will change.\n\n\u201cIn the UK, and the west in general, we have developed an environment where people don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about things like perimenopause because of associations with ageing,\u201d he says. \u201cMany cultures don\u2019t suffer from the same taboos as us \u2013 one study of Mayan culture found that the menopause was associated with freedom and status, and was therefore a positive milestone in life.\u201d\n\nThe design of the wristband, says Astbury, is an attempt to break down this stigma. \u201cThe aim is for women to wear Grace with confidence \u2013 the hope is that more people will feel they can openly talk about menopause.\u201d\n\nAstbury is hopeful that a change is taking place: \u201cWomen are increasingly talking openly about menopause and its effects,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope that this change gains traction and that our culture continues to evolve and become more and more open about all health-related topics.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

Over the past 12 months, the Guardian has published the names and, where possible, the faces and stories of the victims in this list. To mark a year of this unique collaboration, Cape Town-based photographer Thom Pierce has been commissioned to take portraits of defenders in some of the world\u2019s worst affected regions.\n\nAlthough the campaigns often start locally and accidentally, several defenders saw themselves caught up in a bigger fight for the natural world.\n\n\n\n'We have become guardians': Turkey's accidental forest protectors Read more\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t realise this at first, but its global,\u201d says Turkish forest defender Tu\u011fba G\u00fcnal. \u201cIf you want to protect the environment, you are treated as a terrorist. It\u2019s everywhere now.\u201d\n\nThey are in the frontline of a battle between those who promote conservation and those who promote consumption. This conflict has become more violent as resources become scarcer. Extractive industries are financing the campaigns of a new generation of political strongmen: Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Turkey, Donald Trump in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro in BrazilAll are committed to eroding the few legal protections that environmental campaigners and indigenous groups are able to use to hold back mines, farms and factories.\n\n\u200b'A hitman could come and kill me': the fight for indigenous land rights in Mexico Read more\n\nA large proportion of killings are linked to government security forces, particularly in the Philippines, which is the most dangerous country in Asia for activists. Many others are carried out by gangs, particularly in Latin America, which accounts for more than half of all deaths.\n\n\u201cAll these 207 activists did was to question the way that business is done. They had the audacity to defend their rights and protect the environment. That they were murdered for that is a damning indictment of the way the goods we buy are produced,\u201d said Ben Leather, a campaigner at Global Witness. \u201cGovernments and businesses are putting profits ahead of people and we, the consumers, should not just be outraged but push them to take responsibility.\u201d\n\n'I tended to the bodies': attacked by the Philippine army Read more\n\nThe regions with the greatest natural and ethnic diversity, have the worst records. Brazil, the biggest Amazon forest nation, has the most deaths followed by the Philippines, which is at the centre of the Coral Triangle. Next comes Colombia, another Amazon nation, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has Africa\u2019s biggest forest, where almost all the victims were forest rangers. The greatest deterioration was in Mexico, where the government\u2019s approval for mining and farming concessions in indigenous territory has contributed to a five-fold increase in deaths over the previous year.\n\n'They should be put in prison': battling Brazil's huge alumina plant Read more\n\nImpunity is a major problem. Defenders are often cheated of land rights by corrupt lawmakers and local politicians. When they resist, they are criminalised. When they are killed, nobody gets punished.\n\nThe majority of the defenders here \u2013 and in the global tallies \u2013 are from indigenous groups and poor black communities, who have been pushed over decades or centuries to the fringes of society. Not coincidentally, that is where nature is most abundant, where resources remain untapped, where the law \u2013 if it is applied at all \u2013 tends to serve as a tool for exploitation rather than justice.\n\n'This is a last hold-out': Son of a murdered farmer in Colombia Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost apartheid. Indigenous people are treated as nobodies,\u201d said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on indigenous rights, who was labelled a terrorist in her own country, the Philippines. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow this to continue or the people who are working to protect the environment will disappear and those who extract will rule the world. We don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nThese low-intensity conflicts rarely make headlines because they are rarely black-and-white, they do not threaten the status quo and because local authorities and the companies that supply us are implicated, albeit often indirectly.\n\n\n\n'I thank god I am alive': standing firm against mineral extraction in South Africa Read more\n\nMost of these activists are fighting against our short-term interests and for our long-term well-being. On one hand, they are resisting the extractive businesses that provide consumers with coffee, palm oil, fish and the titanium, aluminium and copper in our laptops, mobile phones and cars. On the other, they are the most effective guardians of global biodiversity and climate stability.\n\nAsked what message they have for readers, some urged consumers to shop carefully, to consider supply chains and boycott firms and products linked with violence. Most, though, said they needed broader political change \u2013 a greater global push for land rights, accountability, transparency, tighter regulations on companies and more efforts to punish the corrupt officials and gang bosses who are often behind the killings.\n\n\n\nThey also seek more international exposure and solidarity in what is increasingly resembling a series of last stands for nature.\n\n'We had no plans for violence': Indian campaign against toxic smelter turned deadly Read more\n\n\u201cSomething in happening in the world. Activists are being branded as terrorists,\u201d says Fatima Babu in India, who recently saw her 24-year campaign against a copper smelter explode into violence with the police killing of 13 protesters. \u201cThis phenomenon of destroying people and the planet for profit is not just happening in India.

My reply is always the same: \u201cActually, we are leaving our home. This is our home.\u201d We are moving to a country that my wife and I were born in and are citizens of, but which our children know only as a holiday destination. There was \u2013 and is \u2013 no burning desire on our part to live in Germany. I never missed the impoliteness, control freakery and permanent moaning that I associate with much of German public life.\n\nThere is, however, a definite urge to leave Britain, a country that has lost its way and, with it, many of its best qualities. In public discourse, pragmatism, level-headedness and tolerance (or at least benevolent indifference) have been largely replaced by uncompromising partisanship. The result of the EU referendum dismayed me, but did not surprise me. Ever since my time at Oxford University in the mid-90s, I had been aware of the deeply entrenched anti-EU sentiment, especially among politics graduate students \u2013 some of whom would go on to work with pro-Brexit politicians and in the media.\n\nWhat that time did not prepare me for was the absurd spectacle that post-referendum British politics has mutated into. There seems to be no fudge, no disaster, no incompetence to which Britain\u2019s current, distressingly myopic and feckless batch of politicians refuse to stoop, be they in government or opposition. The unworkable white paper thrashed out at Chequers, and the resignations, parliamentary chaos and no-deal threats resulting from it, have thrown the current level of ineptitude in British politics into sharp relief.\n\nAfter the referendum, there was a shift in my journalistic remit. Before, I had what I will always consider the best job imaginable \u2013 reporting on the arts for the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung from the most culturally exciting and diverse city in the world. It was every arts journalist\u2019s dream: I covered everything from the Turner prize to the Booker prize and interviewed artists such as Anish Kapoor, Ian McKellen and the Rolling Stones.\n\nSince 24 June 2016, however, my job has been wall-to-wall Brexit coverage. I would not have been doing it properly if it had been any different. From a British perspective, it is the defining topic of our era, even though many Brits seem to prefer to ignore it, hoping it will just go away. In the run-up to the implementation of article 50 in March 2017, for instance, I started writing a daily \u201cCountdown\u201d column covering stories such as the diminished \u201cBrexit Toblerone\u201d to the harassment of our Polish friends after the referendum \u2013 and tracing how my perception of Britain had been changed by the result.\n\nBrexit even made its way into arts coverage \u2013 for example, the National Gallery\u2019s attempt to buy a painting by Jacopo da Pontormo from a US banker was scuppered by the slump in sterling, while the European Union Youth Orchestra, which had always had its headquarters in London, was forced to move to Italy.\n\nMy journeys outside the London bubble, before as well as after the referendum, made me aware of the broad spectrum of reasons for the Brexit vote, as well as of the fallout that is already happening, or is on the horizon. They showed me a Britain that is divided and directionless. Yet, looking at much of the domestic coverage, you would not know this. In most British media, journalists seem biased and underinformed in equal measure \u2013 and peddle the \u201cwill of the people\u201d line unchallenged. One of the untruths repeated unquestioningly is the British government\u2019s assertion that the status of the 3 million EU-citizens in this country is secure. Despite official protestations, it is still unclear what this status will be after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. If the \u201csettlement scheme\u201d that the home secretary, Sajid Javid, has announced goes ahead, we would at best have to apply and pay to secure as a privilege something that free movement has so far guaranteed. Free movement is neither a privilege nor some kind of transactional immigration deal. It is a reciprocal arrangement between EU member states, which formed the legal basis of our move to Britain all those years ago. It has been changed unilaterally by the British government. We had no say in it.\n\nBeing used as bargaining chips for two years and then allowed to stay in our home for a fee, turning from citizens into supplicants, is hardly a democratic process \u2013 even though, currently, it is the best-case scenario. The assertion that \u201cnothing\u2019s agreed until everything\u2019s agreed\u201d, recently reiterated by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, makes it clear that, should there be a no-deal Brexit, all of this would be irrelevant. At worst, we could be stuck in Britain with no legal status at all. In the light of all this, it is surely better to jump than wait to be pushed.\n\nTo those who are tempted to reassure us that \u201cit won\u2019t happen\u201d, I can only say: look at the many instances over the past few years where you said the same, and then precisely that thing happened. Of course, Germany has its own problems. In her capricious interior minister, Horst Seehofer, Angela Merkel now has her own Boris Johnson-type loose cannon. However, in Germany at least we won\u2019t be totally politically disenfranchised. EU citizens had no say in any of the Brexit decisions \u2013 Commonwealth citizens living in the UK were allowed to participate in the EU referendum, we weren\u2019t; and we never had the vote in parliamentary elections. What our status would be in local elections (which we have been able to vote in so far) is up in the air, as everything is still legally unclear.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Heading for disaster? Theresa May discusses Brexit with her cabinet at Chequers last month. Photograph: Joel Rouse/Joel Rouse/MoD/Crown Copyright\n\nI imagine reactions to our departure will range from, \u201cOh, but we didn\u2019t mean people like you\u201d to \u201cGood riddance, you won\u2019t be missed\u201d. To the former, I would reply: it doesn\u2019t matter; the damage is done. Brexit will affect all EU citizens in the UK (and UK citizens in the EU) equally, and you don\u2019t get to pick and choose. I do, however, tend to agree with the latter. The country won\u2019t suffer terribly from having one fewer foreign arts journalist. It will be harder to replace the rest of my family, though. My sons \u2013 13, 11, and seven years old \u2013 have dual citizenship but are all UK-born and have never lived outside Cricklewood, north-west London. All three were among the best students in their respective classes. They are rooted in Britain, and have visited (and in some cases been dragged to) more National Trust and English Heritage sites than you can shake a stick at.\n\nWhen a young and very likable England team beat Colombia in their World Cup penalty shoot-out, my sons were delighted about the win. These were English boys supporting England. My children never had to choose between their German and British \u201cidentities\u201d \u2013 a choice which I still hope they will never have to make. They have been very understanding about the reasoning behind the move. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are leaving behind all their friends and, after a life shaped by the multiculturalism of one of the world\u2019s great metropolises, now they will have to get used to an environment that is very different. For example, during our visit to his new school in Germany, one of my sons remarked, with some incredulity: \u201cThis is so weird \u2013 all the students are white!\u201d\n\nMy wife, meanwhile, is leaving behind her post as a paediatric consultant at a London hospital. It was her firm belief in the egalitarian principles of the National Health Service, as well as the excellent medical training, that brought us to Britain in 2004. Her skillset and expertise, which she was fully committed to offer the NHS for the rest of her career, will now be applied elsewhere, just like those of many other excellent healthcare professionals from the EU.\n\nA parliamentary briefing by the British Medical Association noted that almost half of doctors from the European Economic Area surveyed were considering leaving the UK after the referendum. And of those, more than a third have made concrete plans \u2013 that is almost one in five EU doctors working in the NHS (18%). A part of my wife\u2019s job entails working with vulnerable children, and it remains unfilled - because the hospital so far has not been able to find a suitable replacement.\n\nHaving listened to myself talking about all of this quite passionately to a British friend, I asked him: \u201cAm I overthinking this?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are overfeeling it.\u201d I have never considered myself an Anglophile; hopefully, my response to this complex nation has been more nuanced than uncritical adoration. But perhaps my friend was right. Our response to Brexit is as much emotional as a practical. Isn\u2019t that correct, though, considering that the leave vote was entirely rooted in emotion? It is not easy to stay calm and rational when faced with the visceral, self-aggrandising, jingoistic drivel that flows endlessly from some in the leave camp. It is painful to see how Britain, particularly England, has bought into its own imperial, nostalgic myth and is now falling prey to the resulting delusions.\n\nThe discrepancy between the Brexit people thought they voted for and the one they will get reminds me a little of the story of Boaty McBoatface: \u201cThe people\u201d voted to give that name to a 125-metre-long, state-of-the-art research vessel with a top speed of 17 knots and a helipad. What they got was a tiny, remote-controlled, unmanned, bright yellow submersible that looks like a suppository. Yet Boaty McBoatface, as disappointing as it may look, is much more useful than any form of Brexit. I would be delighted if this great project of national self-harm were not to happen. Unfortunately, I think it will, and we want to be gone when it does. For whatever shape Brexit takes, it will inevitably be worse than what we \u2013 what all of us \u2013 had before.", "sentiment": 0.10888947368421056, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Auf wiedersehen, Britain: Brexit is forcing my German family to leave the country we call home"}, {"published": "2016-04-28T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/28/story-cities-32-new-york-jane-jacobs-robert-moses", "text": "When city planning supremo Robert Moses proposed a road through Greenwich Village in 1955, he met opposition from one particularly feisty local resident: Jane Jacobs. It was the start of a decades-long struggle for swaths of New York\n\nIn 1961, Bennett Cerf, one of the founders of the publishing firm Random House, sent a copy of a new book by Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of American Cities, to the legendary city planner Robert Moses. Moses\u2019s reply was curt:\n\nDear Bennett, I am returning the book you sent me. Aside from the fact that it is intemperate and inaccurate, it is also libelous. I call your attention, for example, to page 131. Sell this junk to someone else. Cordially, Robert Moses\n\nThis was no ordinary demurral over a book\u2019s merits. It was a salvo in a struggle between a man who had amassed vast bureaucratic powers and remade New York with expressways, parks and housing towers, and the woman who assembled neighbours and public opinion to stop him when he set his sights on the evisceration of a swath of lower Manhattan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Moses stands in front of the Manhattan skyline in 1956. Photograph: AP\n\nMoses was an avatar of the early 20th-century vision that the only salvation of cities was the large-scale destruction of their existing features, and Jacobs an exemplar of another, which maintained that the future of cities rested on preserving exactly those qualities. Jacobs\u2019 book was the most powerful retort to Moses\u2019s mode of thinking, and her actions a resounding retort to his mode of operating.\n\nThe struggles between Jacobs and Moses loom large in the popular consciousness. The subject of books by Roberta Brandes-Gratz and Anthony Flint, they now feature in what is surely the world\u2019s first opera about an urban planning dispute, A Marvelous Order, which premiered last month.\n\nThe only hazard to this libretto is that their conflict, which has become an iconic representation of the tension between top-down and organic notions of urbanism, was one in which most contact was indirect. In fact they encountered each other in person only once. Moses\u2019s sneering dismissal of Jacobs\u2019s book was one of very few direct acknowledgements of her existence.\n\nThis is fitting since both worked through realms of indirect influence and power: Moses within the byzantine and barely accountable tangle of New York\u2019s public authority powers; Jacobs in the inherently decentralised world of community organising and writings about urbanism. But however indirect the sparring, there\u2019s no doubt who prevailed in the end.\n\n\u2018Immense behind-the-scenes influence\u2019\n\n\n\nDespite never winning a single election, Robert Moses reigned over a set of principalities that would rival a Habsburg monarch. At his peak he held 12 offices, the most prominent being the New York city parks commissioner, state parks council head, and chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The latter, created in 1933 to oversee construction of the set of bridges connecting Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, was pivotal, providing Moses with a steady stream of revenue that he leveraged into countless other construction projects.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The world\u2019s first opera about an urban planning dispute.\n\nAs Robert Caro wrote in his epochal tome The Power Broker, \u201cMoses \u2026 displayed a genius for using the wealth of his public authorities to unite behind his aims banks, labor unions, contractors, bond underwriters, insurance firms, the great retail stores, real estate manipulators \u2013 all the forces which enjoy immense behind-the-scenes political influence in New York.\u201d\n\nMoses\u2019s early construction was largely confined to Long Island: he steadily knit his spider\u2019s web of roads nearer the heart of the city, bulldozing increasingly dense urban fabric and eventually setting his sights on Washington Square Park, the historic centre of Greenwich Village.\n\nWashington Square Park anchored the Village, offering 10 acres of green space to a steadily changing set of neighbours, from Edith Wharton to Bob Dylan. In 1880, Henry James wrote in Washington Square of its \u201crural and accessible appearance\u201d \u2013 a quality that had not entirely dimmed by the 1950s. Moses, however, upon looking at the park, was convinced that the amenity it most sorely lacked was a four-lane road through its centre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artist\u2019s sketch from 1959 of the proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway, a 10-lane highway through SoHo and Little Italy that required the demolition of 416 buildings. Photograph: AP\n\nOne neighbourhood resident, Jane Jacobs, received a flyer from the Committee to Save Washington Square Park in 1955, providing notice of the proposal to extend Manhattan\u2019s 5th Avenue through the park. Jacobs, born in the small city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, had arrived in the neighbourhood in the 1930s, holding a variety of writing jobs culminating in work for the prominent publication Architectural Forum.\n\nThere is nobody against this plan \u2013 nobody but a bunch of MOTHERS! Robert Moses\n\nNews of the proposed roadway provoked alarm. In a letter to the city\u2019s mayor, Jacobs wrote: \u201cIt is very discouraging to do our best to make the city more habitable and then to learn that the city is thinking up schemes to make it uninhabitable.\u201d Moses\u2019s previous road plans had an unerring tendency to become reality. Jacobs set about ensuring that this one didn\u2019t.\n\nShe rapidly took on the roles of both strategist and media and community liaison with the park\u2019s committee, displaying a great skill for community organising \u2013 enlisting supporters both small and large, from local children to prominent neighbourhood residents such as Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Washington Square Park in 2016. Photograph: Ali Smith for the Guardian\n\nJacobs cultivated the media in all its forms, garnering the support of independent press such as the nascent Village Voice. Nor were traditional levers of power neglected: the support of Carmine DeSapio, New York secretary of state, Democratic machine politician and Village resident, proved very helpful. The Board of Estimate (a city body controlling land use decisions) was prevailed upon to drop the plan.\n\nIt was amid this process that Jacobs saw Moses for the only time, as she reported to James Howard Kunstler in a Metropolis Magazine interview:\n\nI saw him only once, at a hearing about the road through Washington Square, which was to be an entrance ramp to the Lower Manhattan Expressway. He was there briefly to speak his piece. But nobody was told that at the time. None of us had spoken yet because they always had the officials speak first and then they would go away and they wouldn\u2019t listen to the people. Anyway, he stood up there gripping the railing, and he was furious at the effrontery of this, and I guess he could already see that his plan was in danger. Because he was saying: \u2018There is nobody against this \u2013 NOBODY, NOBODY, NOBODY but a bunch of \u2026 a bunch of MOTHERS!\u2019 And then he stomped out.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The official 1936 opening of the Triborough Bridge, a construction project which helped consolidate Robert Moses\u2019s political power. Photograph: AP\n\nJacobs continued her struggle against urban renewal by articulating a positive vision of the \u201cteeming city\u201d in a 1958 article for Fortune magazine \u2013 which led to the commission of her masterwork, The Death and Life of American Cities.\n\nThe city is like an insane asylum run by the most far-out inmates Jane Jacobs\n\nThis broadside against the prevailing scientific rationalism of urban planning extolled diversities of usage, old buildings and the organic structures of cities: \u201cWhy have cities not, long since, been identified, understood and treated as problems of organised complexity?\u201d It was a powerful call in an era in which any such complexity was the very thing that planners were looking to organise out of existence.\n\nAnother such effort arose about a month after Jacobs had finished her manuscript. The city\u2019s Housing and Redevelopment Board was pursuing a study intended to classify a large area of Greenwich Village south of Washington Square Park as \u201cblighted\u201d, in order to enable large-scale redevelopment. Moses was not personally responsible but his associates headed the effort. Jacobs soon became co-chair of a Committee to Save the West Village, devising a new set of efforts to derail the flattening of her neighbourhood.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jane Jacobs at a press conference in Greenwich Village in 1961. Photograph: Alamy\n\nMoses\u2019s efforts had frequently glided forward thanks to assertions of expert knowledge unavailable to the general public and the skilful manipulation of civic processes. Jacobs fought back on both fronts. The committee conducted their own survey of neighbourhood conditions to rebut the \u201cblighted\u201d designation, collecting ample documentation that the neighbourhood was not, in fact, a slum.\n\nPublic hearings on the proposal had not been held, as mandated by law; Jacobs obtained an order from a state judge that they must take place. It soon emerged that the City Planning Commission had already, surreptitiously, designated the area as blighted.\n\nA frequent Moses tactic, aped by the city in these proceedings, was to schedule public hearings at short-notice, to avoid mobilised resistance. But Jacobs had a source at City Hall providing regular tips, and worked to deluge these meetings with opposed citizens.\n\nAdditional skulduggery was unearthed. She noticed the same irregular \u201cr\u201d appearing both on press releases from the real estate company charged with redeveloping the area, and on statements from an ostensible community group in support of the redevelopment. The latter was revealed as a front that had vastly misrepresented the scale of the project proposed to neighbourhood residents.\n\nRising public distaste with the secrecy and collusion at work in the process led to the city\u2019s abandonment of the \u201cblighted\u201d designation, and its plans for redevelopment. By then, however, another, potentially more destructive, threat awaited.\n\n\u2018A monstrous and useless folly\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Lower Manhattan Expressway was an effort to tie up the loose ends of local roadways by extending Interstate 78 \u2013 all 10 lanes of it \u2013 from the Holland Tunnel to the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. The obstacle was the streetscape of SoHo and Little Italy, and the great variety of uses within that the city found dispensable.\n\n\u201cThe grand total for proposed demolition was 416 buildings that housed 2,200 families, 365 retail stores, and 480 other commercial establishments,\u201d wrote Anthony Flint in Wrestling with Moses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greenwich Village residents protest against Robert Moses\u2019s plans to build the Lower Manhattan Expressway in 1960. Photograph: Alamy\n\nThe area was both densely settled and architecturally significant, containing one of the greatest collections of cast-iron architecture in the world. Yet neither factor registered as even slightly consequential initial objections to a fresh new expressway \u2013 and one eligible for 90% federal funding as part of the Interstate Highway system.\n\nThe expressway had the support of the city, the Regional Plan Association, the American Institute of Architects, the Municipal Art Society, business groups and construction workers\u2019 associations.\n\nOnce again, Jacobs set about forging a diverse local coalition to stop it.\n\nAn organic network of support was developed, drawing on a diverse set of local residents, Puerto Ricans, Italians, intellectuals, labourers and, rumour has it, even the mafia \u2013 united by a common opposition to their homes and businesses becoming a merge lane.\n\nJacobs\u2019s coalition pursued both short- and long-term tactics, obtaining delays for resident relocation studies while holding frequent rallies \u2013 one featuring residents in gas masks, to dramatise the likely increase in pollution \u2013 and blanketing any public hearings with opposition. She herself offered frequent quotable barbs, once describing the expressway at a Board of Estimate meeting as a \u201cmonstrous and useless folly\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New York\u2019s SoHo district is still home to some of the world\u2019s most famous cast-iron architecture. Photograph: Michael Pasdzior/Getty Images\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor, Robert F Wagner, halted the condemnation proceedings in 1962. But the expressway was a beast that refused to be slain, thanks to continued support from powerful backers \u2013 none more powerful than Moses. By 1965, the mayor announced his renewed support, offering a slightly altered plan that submerged parts of the expressway complex, as well as a proposal for some new housing as a sop to relocated residents.\n\nMayoral challenger John Linsday took up the baton of expressway opposition \u2013 yet once elected, he too went about tweaking the proposal in the hopes of making it more palatable. New versions included an 80-foot elevation and an ultra-modern Paul Rudolph proposal for a wrapping of new housing. Multi-lane highways are, however, a difficult dish to make appetising.\n\nThe city\u2019s steamroller processes continued. At one public meeting concerning the project, writes Flint, \u201cthe microphone faced toward the audience, not the officials the residents were nominally addressing ... suggest[ing] that state officials were just going through the motions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe city is like an insane asylum run by the most far-out inmates,\u201d Jacobs pronounced. She led protesters on to the stage, and the stenographer\u2019s record of the meeting was destroyed. She was arrested and jailed for a night on charges including inciting a riot and criminal mischief, and could have faced years in prison if convicted.\n\nJacobs eventually determined to leave New York. Her architect husband had obtained a commission in Toronto, and she was eager to take her sons beyond the risk of the draft for Vietnam. She left in 1968 \u2013 not in defeat, however, but in victory. The expressway project had lost all steam, and Mayor Lindsay declared it scrapped the following summer.\n\nStory of cities #33: how Santiago tackled its housing crisis with 'Operation Chalk' Read more\n\nMoses received his final comeuppance in the same year, undone by the internal manoeuvrings in government that had so elevated him, as Governor Nelson Rockefeller engineered the dissolution of his most lasting fiefdom, the Triborough Bridge Authority. While Jacobs went on to enjoy a distinguished career as author and urbanist, Moses descended into increasing obloquy. He died in 1981, Jacobs in 2006 \u2013 one largely reviled, the other venerated.\n\n\u201cAnd sure enough,\u201d wrote Tom Wolfe in 2007, \u201cover the past 40 years, the rebirth of Lower Manhattan from Chelsea to Tribeca, of northern Brooklyn, of Astoria and Long Island City in Queens, has taken place without razing a single building in the name of \u2018urban renewal\u2019, or shooing away a single citizen through \u2018eminent domain\u2019.\u201d\n\nJacobs \u2013 one of those common citizens, denigrated at the time as merely a \u201chousewife\u201d \u2013 has, perhaps more than any other, offered inspiration to those informed that plans drawn up in the corridors of power will require them to move elsewhere.

You\u2019re not going to get an immediate 25 tournaments.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Spanish federation and the Swedish; not to have the Swedish Open, I don\u2019t understand that. They\u2019ve had so many great players over the years. We had a really good Swedish event but the prize money wasn\u2019t good enough. Players weren\u2019t going because it was too low. But how we don\u2019t have tournaments in most countries \u2026 I\u2019ve got no idea.\n\n\u201cIf we got 15 really good European events; and I\u2019m not talking \u20ac200,000 events, because no one is making any money on 200,000. It would have to be 4-, 5-, 600,000 now because things are expensive on tour.\u201d\n\nEuropean Sports Championships: launch pad for a new spectacle of sport Read more\n\nDavies, a 12-times Solheim Cup player, believes it may eventually impact on the biennial event. \u201cThe trouble is what it will become,\u201d she added. \u201cThe top Europeans who play on the LPGA against the top Americans of the LPGA and that would be a shame.\u201d\n\nCatriona Matthew, the Solheim Cup captain, offered a slightly more positive outlook. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard the schedule next year is looking strong. There\u2019s already two new tournaments and hopefully a few others in the pipeline. So hopefully it\u2019s hit the bottom and we\u2019re on the way up now.\u201d When Georgia Hall, last year\u2019s LET order of merit winner, came in to echo Matthew\u2019s sentiment, it had the feeling of an edict from above.\n\nHome hopes for the Open will undoubtedlyrest to a large extent on Charley Hull, who is seeking a maiden major win. The 22-year-old shared 10th in this event a year ago. In 2006 Hull made her Lytham debut as a 10-year-old invitee in the tournament pro-am.\n\n\u201cMonday was my first time back on the course since,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little bit of extra pressure here because it\u2019s your home championship but I don\u2019t really think of it like that. I just want to go out there, give myself a chance and see if I can push it and go ahead and win it. I really like the feeling of the pressure over the last few holes.\u201d", "sentiment": 0.27696666666666675, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s not good, is it?\u2019 \u2013 Laura Davies worried about future of European Tour"}, {"published": "2018-07-25T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2018/jul/25/inner-city-cricket-is-ethnic-minority-talent-being-missed", "text": "30% of recreational cricketers in the UK are from South Asian backgrounds, but that group is represented by just 4% of professionals.

The bombs fell close to a hospital and fish market in the strategic Yemeni port of Hodeidah, which has been the focus of fierce fighting in recent weeks.\n\n\n\nGriffiths\u2019s call for talks is seen as a potentially significant breakthrough in Yemen\u2019s civil war, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives and left millions of people on the brink of starvation.\n\nA joint Saudi and United Arab Emirate coalition has been fighting to win back control of Yemen from Iran-backed Houthi rebels since March 2015.\n\nThe scale and timing of the Saudi air strike have been seen by some diplomats either as an attempt to sabotage the Griffiths plan \u2013 or a bloody signal that the Saudis were not willing to conciliate.\n\nThe International Red Cross said it was sending medical equipment to the Al Thawra hospital to treat 50 people in critical condition. There was no immediate comment from the Saudi coalition.\n\nYemen has widely been described as the world\u2019s greatest humanitarian crisis. Between January and May, aid agencies helped 7.5 million people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said this week.\n\nThe war escalated after a Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in 2015 to restore the UN-recognised government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, months after he had been overthrown by Houthi rebels.\n\nIncreasingly, the war has taken on the characteristics of a wider regional conflict, with Iranians backing the Houthis in their efforts to push back the Saudi offensive.\n\nThe UN-sponsored talks, if they go ahead, might avert a Saudi and UAE-led offensive on the strategic port of Hodeidah, which is held by Houthis and used by aid agencies to distribute food, medicine and oil through most of the country.\n\nBombed into famine: how Saudi air campaign targets Yemen\u2019s food supplies Read more\n\nThe UAE announced an assault on Hodeidah on 12 June, capturing Hodeidah airport, but under international pressure has backed off from a full-scale military offensive to take the port and city.\n\nThe aid sector has said an attack would cut off aid to the rest of the country, and an outbreak of guerrilla warfare would lead to civilian casualties.\n\nMore than 30,000 people have been displaced in the Hodeidah governorate. The UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Lise Grande, said this week that airstrikes hitting the city\u2019s water infrastructure risked causing a cholera outbreak.\n\nThe UK had urged the UAE not to start a full military offensive, but a fortnight ago it appeared to have accepted, in public at least, that little more could be done to change Saudi-UAE strategy.\n\nThe appointment of special envoy Griffiths, a former British diplomat, was seen as a fresh chance to end the stalemate, and he has been shuttling between both sides for about a month trying to widen a possible deal over Hodeidah\u2019s future into a broader agreement to hold talks on the future of the country as a whole.\n\nHis most recent talks were in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a, and Riyadh, but he has also met UN ambassadors in New York.\n\nThe Houthis, backed by Iran, had offered for the port to be put under UN-administered control, but the UAE insisted the Houthis needed to withdraw not just from the port but also the adjoining city, a move that would have exposed Sana\u2019a to a further assault.\n\nAsked whether it was possible for talks to start without a ceasefire throughout Yemen, Karen Pierce, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the UN, said on Wednesday: \u201cAre there precedents where talking and fighting can happen at the same time? Yes there are.\u201d\n\nPrevious Yemen talks were held in Switzerland in 2015 and Kuwait in 2016. Since then, diplomatic efforts to bring both sides together have proved fruitless, even though the international community has repeatedly asserted there was no military solution to the conflict.\n\nThe Saudi-led bombing campaign that has frequently hit civilian targets including hospitals, schools and weddings has hugely damaged Saudi Arabia\u2019s international reputation and led to pressure in Europe and the US for governments to end all arms sales to Riyadh.\n\nThere have been warnings that the offensive around Hodeidah was displacing thousands of children. According to Save the Children, 3,000 Yemeni children a day were fleeing from the port city.\n\nThe aid organisation described the escape routes from the city as often perilous, with families \u201chaving to brave minefields, airstrikes and being forced to cross areas of active fighting\u201d to escape.\n\nTamer Kirolos, Save the Children\u2019s country director for Yemen, described Hodeida as a ghost town. \u201cThe streets are empty even in the day and there are checkpoints everywhere. The devastation that airstrikes and shelling have caused is clear to see.\u201d\n\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire and urged Yemen\u2019s warring parties to join UN peace efforts.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Beaumont", "sentiment": -0.13002424242424246, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "UN envoy confirms first Yemen peace talks in two years"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/aug/02/family-day-trips-uk-gardens-beaches-museums", "text": "Winning tip: Folkestone seafront, Kent\n\nYou may not hear people saying \u201cyou really must get down to Folkestone\u201d a lot, but after much investment and regeneration, this seaside town offers a great day out for all tastes and budgets.

As well as this fresh drama, Scorpion shuttles between the standard Drake poles of confected beef, self-aggrandisement and light-hearted croonery; like all his albums, it\u2019s too long but still contains plenty of future best-of material. In My Feelings is a highlight \u2013 some might see this and his other takes on New Orleans bounce (Child\u2019s Play, Nice For What etc) as defanging the sharp attack of the style, but he cleverly pairs its propulsion with a much more romantic mood.

Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThis month saw another two drops from the rapper\u2019s upcoming album Queen, which she has been talking up as her greatest yet. The big single Bed, reuniting her with Ariana Grande, is a little underwhelming compared with their great ode to cervical bruising, Side to Side, but Rich Sex is richly satisfying. While Minaj is always remarkably on point at speed, it\u2019s her slower flows, where she lets each word roll round her lips and slope off her tongue, that are among her best (think Beez in the Trap), and this is a classic example. Lil Wayne also turns up with a gross but gorgeously elastic guest verse.\n\nAdopting someone else\u2019s persona in pop is tricky to pull off: unlike film and literature, you don\u2019t see the narrative devices and simply have to trust what you hear. Sometimes it\u2019s awful \u2013 see Lil Dicky \u2013 but sometimes, as on Ebony Bones\u2019 first single in three years, it\u2019s bold and daring. No Black in the Union Jack focuses on the overt racism and xenophobia legitimised by Brexit. It samples Enoch Powell\u2019s \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech and the sound of two neighbours laughing as they exchange racist epithets, while Bones adopts the racists\u2019 mindset in her own lyrics: \u201cRed, white and blue / Let \u2018em in to smash the system now the country is screwed,\u201d she raps coolly over a stark, looped beat that clatters and glowers. It\u2019s not quite the British answer to Childish Gambino\u2019s This Is America, but it\u2019s close.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Blawan. Photograph: Marie Staggat\n\nBlawan has been a UK techno hero for years now \u2013 tracks like 2012\u2019s wildly catchy Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage? showcased his talent for pounding kicks and nagging melody, while his most famous moment remains his Brandy-sampling funky house cut Getting Me Down. He\u2019s finally released his debut album Wet Will Always Dry: masterful minimal techno in the Nina Kraviz or Radio Slave mould, where unceasing 4/4 hauteur is brightened with mischievous licks. Tasser is a highlight: the core drum programming ticks along like a Roomba, but is menaced again and again by a magnificently amorphous cloud of static.\n\nWhen every X Factor contestant and their dog can do a full-tilt Whitney warble, there\u2019s something even more impressive about the kind of singer who keeps their melisma skill hidden, playing it as their ace. To wit, LA synthpop artist Miya Folick\u2019s latest single, where a soaring falsetto high enough to tickle God\u2019s beard bursts unexpectedly from her brow-furrowed verses about feeling a bit drab. It takes Stock Image from subtle greys to blazing colour, while the tense euphoria of the drum machine earns its comparisons to peak Robyn.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jess Sah Bi & Peter One.\n\nAnother great discovery from the Awesome Tapes from Africa label, which has previously brought us Hailu Mergia, Ata Kak and more, Jess Sah Bi & Peter One are a fairly unlikely proposition. A political cartoonist and a history teacher from the Ivory Coast, they made twanging country music from slide guitar, peppy strumming, and yearning vocals in three languages. They got stadium-level massive following the release of their 1985 debut, Our Garden Needs Its Flowers, and ended up moving to the US. Currently working on music separately, there are reunion plans for later this year once the album is back out.\n\nThis Swedish classic rock band, now 10 years and four albums deep, are utterly, brilliantly preposterous. Powered by the same combination of riffs, synths and peacocking used by their compatriots Europe, and with a fixation on outer space, their tightly harmonised oeuvre begs to be hollered wearing a wolf\u2019s pelt while riding a hoverboard. Speedwagon is glorious, nodding to its AOR namesake as well as Thin Lizzy, ELO, Hall and Oates, Bon Jovi and every glam metal band ever, all condensed into a hyper-melodic ball of hair and chrome. Rock song of the year?\n\nStill bashing out existential freakouts set to bourgeois garage rock, Interpol retain their uniquely anxious energy on their first new track in four years. The major label sheen that left some of their albums feeling genuinely empty rather than performatively so has gone, thankfully replaced with blown-out drums and scuzzy rhythm guitar; Daniel Kessler\u2019s pealing lead could have come from Obstacle 2 on their debut. As ever Paul Banks\u2019s voice, delivering poetry that seems to yearn for sexual and spiritual uplift, is the last word in seedy NY cool.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Low. Photograph: Shelly Mosman\n\nThe Duluth trio aren\u2019t short of menace at the best of times, but they\u2019ve never exuded such a sickly, shuddering spirit as on the three taster tracks from their forthcoming 12th album, Double Negative. Dancing and Blood is the most song-like of these corrosive, ambient oozes: a beat that sounds like heavy steps through coal dust suggests total desolation, while tiny synth flickers conjure images of an abandoned building that still shudders with electric current. It is phenomenally chilling (and reminiscent of Burial at his most haunting) not least thanks to Mimi Parker\u2019s unforgiving judgments echoing through the murk: \u201cAll that you gave wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Highly recommended that you chase this with strawberry ice cream and a Love Island binge.\n\nOne of last year\u2019s most fascinating reissues was a collection of 1970s and 80s work by Carl Stone, an American electronic composer, touring the UK this week, who timestretches samples and live instrumentation into glitchy burbles or transcendent ambient passages. Just as his peer Laurie Spiegel accidentally invented techno around the same time as the earliest midwest electronic dance music, Stone was understanding the collaged power of sampling at the same time hip-hop was doing so in a completely different way. Now there\u2019s a new compilation of four of his 80s and 90s pieces \u2013 all are amazing, but Mae Yao is almost unbearably beautiful. Over 23 minutes, what starts as choppy gamelan glitching gets smoothed out by a wondrous set of quavering, manipulated tones. Is it a voice, an instrument, the wind? The point is that Stone uncouples it from recognisable timbre, leaving it as pure, contextless sound \u2013 a staggering announcement of the universality of beauty.", "sentiment": 0.26868863636363643, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "50 great tracks for July from Drake, Ebony Bones, Low and more"}, {"published": "2018-04-10T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2018/apr/10/sydney-urban-sprawl-suburbs-pictures-photography-andrew-merry", "text": "Woodcroft, north-west Sydney.

The combination helped him land investment banking jobs at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Securities LLC before he moved to Galleon as an analyst.\n\nIllustrator: Andrew Archer for Bloomberg Markets\n\nAt first biotechnology exchange-traded funds figured only into his presentations; by the time he was managing a portfolio, though, he\u2019d begun investing in them, relying mostly on the two largest funds\u2014IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI)\u2014to gain short-term exposure and to hedge. He also felt the products were far from perfect. Some of the ETFs were exposed to specialty pharmaceutical companies; others lumped risky \u00adearly-stage companies with more established ones into a single ETF. The characteristics were so dramatically different, Yook says, it didn\u2019t \u201cmake sense to put those companies in the same fund.\u201d\n\nReturning to New York in 2014, he decided to turn his big idea into a reality by designing biotechnology ETFs on his own. Yook took his idea to Andrew McDonald, who in 2010 had co-founded LifeSci Advisors, a life-sciences investor-relations consulting company. They decided to join forces and introduced a pair of ETFs that December. BioShares Biotechnology Products Fund, or BBP, looked at established companies that had already received approval to market a drug; BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials Fund, or BBC, focused on young companies that were testing drugs in human clinical trials. The funds were equally stock-weighted to avoid missing out on exposure to smaller companies. At the time, ETFs and the biotech sector were both booming. Yook was confident investors would flock to their offerings faster than white-blood cells to an infection.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened, at first. The ETFs benefited from the rally in biotechnology, attracting more than $70 million in total by the end of that July. Then the market turned. By June of this year, neither of his BioShares ETFs had exceeded the $50 million threshold needed to make a profit and attract the big brokerages\u2019 attention. \u201cThe asset growth has been solid\u201d\u2014BBP has gathered about $35 million, BBC about $23 million\u2014\u00ad\u201cbut a far cry from what we expected,\u201d Yook says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically a battle between King Kong, Godzilla, and Mothra, with everybody else fighting over scraps and crumbs\u201d\n\nIn an increasingly crowded market, where more than 2,000 ETFs compete for assets in the U.S. alone, many upstarts face challenges such as Yook\u2019s. More and more firms are shuttering ETFs that fail to accrue assets, resulting in a record 98 closures last year. Others are merging and forming partnerships with larger companies. Jim Ross, who oversees State Street Corp.\u2019s ETF business and helped start the first one in 1993\u2014the mighty SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY)\u2014has a blunt message for new issuers. \u201cI talk to a lot of folks getting into this space,\u201d Ross says. \u201cI say, \u2018Listen, if you don\u2019t have a strategy to get to your first $50 million, don\u2019t come in. You are wasting your money.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the dominance of BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street is staggering: Together they oversee 83 percent of the ETF market in the U.S. The 50 largest funds in the world are theirs. They also capture more than half the American industry\u2019s fee revenue, despite the bargain-basement prices they charge for many products. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a battle between King Kong, Godzilla, and Mothra, with everybody else fighting over scraps and crumbs,\u201d says Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIndeed, there are more than 70 other issuers in just the U.S., each hawking its indexes with stock tickers in letter arrangements you might expect to see in a spoonful of alphabet soup: SCIF, DZK, EDZ, LABD. The beauty of ETFs is that they let investors buy or sell exposure to an entire sector, market, or country as easily as a stock. And these funds are simple to understand, typically tracking an index that prescribes \u00adexactly what a fund can own. An index is a passive investment by definition, even if the securities in the index are more than likely picked by someone (or someone\u2019s methodology). Still, because you don\u2019t really need an expensive manager to make such decisions, ETFs are cheaper than traditional mutual funds. \u201cBecause the ETF landscape is so competitive,\u201d Balchunas says, \u201cinvestors can now get a fully diversified, \u00adinstitutional-caliber portfolio for an all-in fee of less than 0.09 percent.\u201d\n\nTo facilitate the slurping of alphabet soup, the most memorable ETFs tell a story. Want to own the S&P 500 (SPY), dabble in cybersecurity (HACK), bet on robots (ROBO), get into bourbon (WSKY), or profit on the obese (SLIM)? And while SPY, HACK, and ROBO have become the stuff of legend, even a good story isn\u2019t always enough. Those latter two ETFs, as clever as they sound, each have market caps under $3 million. In fact, 40 percent of funds manage less than $50 million\u2014that magic number at which the average ETF breaks even.\n\nTo put it another way, size matters, and not only for the fund\u2019s internal economics. Pension funds and insurers often require a minimum amount of assets to consider a particular ETF. And many funds are stuck in a chicken-and-egg purgatory, wherein a handful of all-powerful wirehouses\u2014including Morgan Stanley, UBS Group AG, and Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch brokerage unit\u2014control access to financial advisers that could steer millions into a fledgling ETF. These advisers control much of the money from mom and pop investors that account for about 70 percent of ETF assets, says Balchunas. Yet funds must hit certain milestones to get onto the big platforms at all, with some brokers demanding as much as $1 billion in assets, a three- to six-month track record, and sometimes an access fee.\n\nNonetheless, the flood of money into passive vehicles can\u2019t be overstated. Passive approaches now account for 35 percent of mutual funds\u2019 stock investments, a figure that Vanguard Group Inc. founder Jack Bogle says could rise to 45 percent over the next five years. ETFs will no doubt continue to benefit if that trend continues, having already jumped from $400 billion in assets a decade ago to about $2.9 trillion today. Active mutual funds, meanwhile, have stalled at about $10 trillion in the U.S.\n\nIn other words, an enormous amount of cash is sloshing around when even a modest cup of froth can make an also-ran\u2019s year. The strategies for filling that cup all differ, but sooner or later you need to claim a bar stool and defend it with sharp elbows.\n\nOr maybe a lightsaber. One speaker at a recent ETF award ceremony even likened the industry to Star Wars: Rooting for BlackRock Inc., he said, was akin to pulling for the Empire. That may give BlackRock a little too much credit, though, because the force is also so strong with Vanguard and State Street.\n\nWhere will the Resistance go from here?\n\nJonathan Steinberg is scrappy by nature. He\u2019s been a Resistance fighter for more than a decade, armed with little more than belief and perseverance. And with that he\u2019s constructed a $40 billion ETF business. Yet even he recognizes things are about to get really tough. The novel approach to indexed investing that\u2019s defined his company, WisdomTree Investments Inc., has gone mainstream, with similar strategies accounting for about 70 percent of funds started in 2016. Chalk up a win for WisdomTree\u2019s instincts but hold the applause: Despite overall assets increasing, the company has slipped behind peers. It\u2019s now the seventh-largest ETF provider in the U.S., down from fifth only three years ago. \u201cYou are always competing with the world\u2019s largest asset managers,\u201d says Steinberg, an impish 52-year-old fizzing with impatient energy. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart.\u201d\n\nA wannabe financial media mogul at the height of the dot-com bubble, in charge of a publishing house that hadn\u2019t turned a profit in years, Steinberg realized then what many only now comprehend: ETFs were the future. He knew the likes of Vanguard would use their bulk to dominate. So as the son of Saul Steinberg\u2014a fearless 1980s corporate raider whose audacious takeover bids and a high-rolling lifestyle flirted with clich\u00e9\u2014he sold up and got in on the game.\n\n\u201cI invested aggressively,\u201d says Steinberg of the single June day in 2006 when he introduced 20 ETFs. \u201cI was accelerating my losses knowing that I was going to go bankrupt, high probability. So I put a burden on myself to raise additional capital fast, but I knew that this was a race.\u201d\n\nIt was. And for a while, WisdomTree held its own, gradually gaining ground amid the behemoths, making its name with so-called smart-beta funds, those that shun traditional indexes tilted toward the largest companies in favor of dividends, value, or growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s stable also has some of the most-traded ETFs, which Balchunas likens to beachfront property if the company ever finds itself in mergers-and-acquisitions negotiations. \u201cThere will likely be major consolidation in the next 10 years,\u201d he says. \u201cAsset management may come to resemble the media industry.\u201d\n\nClever ideas may have helped propel Steinberg to date, but they may not be the answer going forward. To that end, WisdomTree has used its funds to create model portfolios that financial advisers can tap into via the company\u2019s website. It\u2019s opened \u00adoffices in London and Tokyo, hired a new head of client solutions, and bought part of a B2B robo advisory platform to capitalize on a shift toward low-cost, online money management. Sure, the product is just as important as ever, Steinberg says, but \u201cwe\u2019re evolving.\u201d\n\nWisdomtree\u2019s struggle to maintain its foothold and even expand is something Deutsche Asset Management knows all about. Despite success as Europe\u2019s second-largest issuer of \u00adexchange-traded \u00adproducts\u2014with backing from its parent, the region\u2019s biggest investment bank\u2014a prized top-10 slot in the U.S. has proved elusive. Deutsche is in 11th place, just ahead of ALPS Advisors Inc. \u201cWe\u2019re in mile 4 of a 26-mile race, so we are still early,\u201d says Fiona Bassett, the 43-year-old Brit brought in to shake up the American ETF business in 2014. \u201cWinning in the U.S. is absolutely critical for our global ambitions.\u201d\n\nWithin months of trading London for New York, Bassett gave the company a boost by selling its commodity-focused ETFs and refocusing the business on the bank\u2019s international chops via a suite of currency-hedged ETFs. Deutsche is now the third-largest manager of these funds in the U.S., with assets increasing 14-fold, to $13.7 billion, under Bassett\u2019s leadership. The business\u2019s overall ETF assets have grown 38 percent under her.\n\nNot bad, but still not enough. Overseas strategies, hedged or otherwise, remain a small allocation for most U.S. investors. About $9 of every $10 that Deutsche manages is in three popular funds that were among its first currency-protected products.\n\nLike WisdomTree, the company looks to brighten its fortunes by reaching new potential buyers. Deutsche has signed up to the smart-beta craze and is marketing multifactor ETFs that pack several of these strategies into one wrapper in a bid to expand its investor base. It\u2019s also pursuing a share of the fixed-income market by undercutting fees on similar existing products. Its website is dotted with \u201cthought leadership\u201d pieces on how to use these funds.\n\nDeutsche is finding that relationships with clients increasingly determine success. \u201cIt\u2019s like talking to your tailor rather than someone who wants to sell you a suit,\u201d says Reinhard Bellet, the company\u2019s head of passive asset management and Bassett\u2019s boss in Frankfurt. \u201cYou cannot just issue a product and say, \u2018Good luck!\u2019 You have to be there, and you have to be a partner of the client, and I think that\u2019s the future of passive: providing service.\u201d\n\nIt takes more than smarts to succeed in the crowded ETF market. You need a game plan that will persuade buyers to place bets with you. \u201cYou do have to get smarter in thinking about distribution,\u201d says Marie Dzanis, head of intermediary distribution for Northern Trust Corp.\u2019s FlexShares-branded ETFs. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like matchmaking. You can date anyone, or you can be very thoughtful about who\u2019s going to appreciate this exposure, this experience.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something Charles Schwab Corp. has mastered. By channeling the techy vibes of its Silicon Valley neighbors, the San Francisco-based company has built 21 funds into the fastest-\u00adgrowing ETF business in the U.S. How? With innovative distribution, not product.\n\nSchwab has set up an ETF superstore, letting clients compare more than 200 ETFs (including its own funds) from 16 providers. The company\u2019s own offerings on its \u00adcommission-free platform are mostly plain vanilla\u2014a large-cap stock ETF or a product that invests in the broad market\u2014but they come with perks. Buyers can get a stamp of approval from Schwab\u2019s advisory services unit, for example, or a low-fee portfolio-modeling service on the side.\n\nSo that\u2019s a Schwab-approved ETF, issued by Schwab, bought via a Schwab platform, for a portfolio designed by Schwab? Right.\n\n\u201cWe have our own proprietary asset management and a huge open architecture platform where clients can choose among every ETF in the industry,\u201d says Jonathan de St. Paer, senior vice president for strategy and product at Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc., or CSIM. \u201cThe Schwab platform is a microcosm of the industry.\u201d This has given CSIM a unique insight into which funds succeed and how investors act, helping it develop a $75 billion ETF business based on economies of scale.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have hundreds and hundreds of products. We\u2019re focused on taking some of our best ideas and turning them into ETFs\u201d\n\nThanks to the wide distribution its ETFs get on Schwab platforms, CSIM can afford to offer funds for next to nothing. Half of the 10 cheapest U.S. ETFs are run by the company, which has offered them free of commission from the outset. That\u2019s elevated Schwab to the fifth-largest ETF issuer, up from 10th three years ago. \u201cEvery investor gets our best price,\u201d Walter Bettinger, Schwab\u2019s chief executive officer, said on a call to shareholders in April. \u201cWe talk about disruption. This is a classic example.\u201d\n\nThe numbers suggest Schwab\u2019s strategy is succeeding. Investors poured more than $11 billion into the company\u2019s ETFs in the first five months of the year. That\u2019s more than the funds from both State Street and Invesco PowerShares, two providers that tower over Schwab in terms of total assets.\n\nAnd the money is sticky. Clients who\u2019ve invested in the asset management arm or used their portfolio solution services on the platform are the largest holders of 13 Schwab ETFs. Robo advisers have also enthusiastically adopted Schwab\u2019s low-cost funds for their low-fee (or often no-fee) investors. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to build niche products for one client set,\u201d St. Paer says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build foundational products.\u201d\n\nWhile Schwab has thrown everything but the kitchen sink into making its ETF business work, others have found success\u2014and assets\u2014another way. At Goldman Sachs, it took only 11 people to pull off one of the most successful startups in ETF history. The investment bank\u2019s money-management arm came out with three ETFs in late 2015, ending two decades on the sidelines; in less than a year, those funds had $2 billion.\n\nThe Goldman secret sauce? Packaging existing strategies and existing clients into the must-have product of the moment. \u201cETFs give us another solution for our clients,\u201d says Michael Crinieri, 52, who moved from Goldman\u2019s securities division to head ETF strategy in July 2014. \u201cPeople are using ETFs in active strategies. We\u2019re focused on offering those building blocks.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) was an unlikely candidate to broach a new passive frontier. Its battalions of doctorates specialized in crafting active strategies, but then came the financial crisis. Investors shunned stock pickers for low-cost indexes, and Goldman suffered three straight years of outflows through 2012. Something had to give. It resolved to halt the exodus, beef up its flailing unit, and create a one-stop investment shop.\n\nAnd that meant introducing ETFs. From 2011 to 2015, Goldman went on a buying spree, acquiring 12 \u00adcompanies\u2014including Westpeak Global Advisors LLC, an expert in quantitative analysis that became the backbone of Goldman\u2019s ETFs. \u201cWhen the ETF business was about traditional indexing, GSAM really didn\u2019t see a fit,\u201d Crinieri says. \u201cAs investors were more interested in products differentiated from traditional market-cap-weighted indexes, all of a sudden GSAM decided that this is what we do, this is what we\u2019re good at, and we can really add value.\u201d\n\nGoldman hired industry experts from BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management Co. And Goldman\u2019s established divisions, including its investment research team, gave GSAM its winning formula\u2014or a version of it\u2014to create products such as an ETF that tracks the hedge fund industry or a fund that buys short-dated Treasuries.\n\nIt worked. Existing clients jumped at the chance to get a Goldman strategy for a lower fee, providing an early boost to assets that helped the products take root, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldman\u2019s largest ETF, a smart-beta fund that selects stocks by calculating their value, momentum, quality, and volatility, can be yours for just nine basis points, less than SPY charges for tracking the S&P 500. The company\u2019s ETFs saw record inflows in April, lifting assets to more than $4 billion.\n\nGoldman won\u2019t corner the ETF market; that\u2019s not its ambition. Rather, it wants to satisfy current clients and give previously underserved investors, such as registered investment advisers, a chance to buy the Goldman brand. \u201cWe\u2019re probably never going to be a Vanguard or IShares,\u201d Crinieri says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have hundreds and hundreds of products. We\u2019re focused on taking some of our best ideas and turning them into ETFs.\u201d\n\nThe meteoric success of Goldman and Schwab shows that there\u2019s still room for newer entrants to make it big in the ETF market, Balchunas says. It\u2019s not easy, but with the right strategy, issuers can carve out a profitable business away from the Big Three. \u201cGoldman Sachs is a great example of a company that successfully made the transition to ETFs\u2014they hired a few industry veterans, did their homework in picking which products to launch, and then hit the streets to make their presence known,\u201d Balchunas says. As for Schwab, it\u2019s \u201ca technological marvel how they can offer up such cheap funds,\u201d he says.\n\nSo bioshares, take heart.\n\nYook certainly isn\u2019t giving up. After the wirehouses ignored their funds, he and McDonald teamed up with a larger asset manager to get the big bucks rolling in. Their ETFs will be sold through that money manager\u2019s distribution arm, leveraging its existing relationships with big brokerages and financial advisers.\n\nYook declined to provide more details about this new partnership because the deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. But when it does, he expects the number of sales professionals selling his ETFs to hit 50 eventually, up from just a handful today. That could be the game changer. \u201cWe realized distribution in a big way is important,\u201d Yook says. \u201cWhat we really need to do is have multiples of what we have.\u201d\n\nOr so hope the Resistance fighters.\n\nEvans covers ETFs in New York.

Even Warren Buffett is impressed. \u201cIt is an unbelievable company,\u201d the legendary investor and Apple stockholder said in May as he marveled that Apple earns almost twice as much as the second-most profitable company in the U.S.\n\nBuffett is right. Apple reported $68 billion in profit before taxes and non-operating items in the last year. In distant second place is JPMorgan Chase & Co. with $39 billion in operating profit.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t another tale of Apple\u2019s impossible-to-believe profit power, because Apple isn\u2019t the powerhouse that it used to be.\n\nApple is now a tale of incredibly shrinking profit margins. Apple generates less profit from each dollar of sales than it did in 2010, when it was worth one-quarter as much. Investors most likely won\u2019t care as long as Apple keeps growing and as long as it continues to churn out eye-popping earnings on an absolute basis. But the slimming margins are a potential warning sign as Apple hits the $1 trillion mark, which reflects investor expectations of fat profits for years to come.\n\nThe biggest reason for the profit margin diet is Apple\u2019s spending. Its operating costs have increased at twice the rate of revenue in the last five years, and the company doesn\u2019t detail why. Growth is coming from different sources, too, notably iPhone price increases and sales of ancillary products. Those changes are giving Apple a fundamentally different financial look, and investors haven\u2019t yet been forced to confront how much this altered Apple should be worth.\n\nMargin Call Apple's operating profit margins are at their lowest point since 2009 Source: Bloomberg\n\nApple\u2019s shifting profit character is dramatic. In the 12 months ended in June, Apple generated 26.6 cents of profit from its business operations for each dollar of sales. That was the lowest operating profit margin since 2009, Bloomberg data show. As a share of revenue, its free cash flow \u2014 the net cash generated by its business minus costs of big-ticket projects such as manufacturing equipment and corporate facilities \u2014 is also near its lowest point since 2009.\n\nEven relative to other corporate titans, Apple has lost a step. Five years ago, Apple ranked 40th among companies in the S&P 500 Index by its annual operating profit margins, according to Bloomberg data. Now the company stands 113th. Apple is squeezing lower profits per dollar than the energy drink company Monster Beverage.\n\nRoll Call More than 100 companies in the S&P 500 have higher profit margins than Apple. A selection: Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe reason for the margin squeeze isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s release of more products packed with expensive parts and technology. Although several key iPhone components are costing Apple more , the company\u2019s total revenue minus the basic costs to make its products hasn\u2019t budged much. The biggest cause of Apple\u2019s shrinking margins is its research and development costs.\n\nFive years ago, Apple was spending about $4 billion a year on research and development, or about 3 percent of its sales. On a percentage basis, that was far lower than other U.S. technology companies. In the last 12 months, Apple\u2019s R&D spending amounted to 5.3 percent of its sales. While that\u2019s still low by tech superstar standards, it\u2019s a significant shift for Apple.\n\nSteve Jobs once said that \u201cinnovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have.\u201d Now it seems as if Apple is putting its foot on the R&D gas, hoping it will result in more innovation.\n\nFinding the Future Apple spends 5 percent of its revenue on research and development, a lower percentage than other U.S. tech giants. But the figure has been rising in recent years. Source: Bloomberg\n\nIt\u2019s true that technology investors want and expect technology companies to invest in the future. The U.S. technology titans are in an arms race, battling with engineer hiring and capital spending to build their capabilities in artificial intelligence, driverless cars, cloud computing and other areas they consider crucial to maintain and extend their dominance. In 2015, the investor Carl Icahn wrote that Apple\u2019s rising R&D spending \u201cshould signal to investors that Apple plans to aggressively pursue\u201d growth opportunities.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s tough for outsiders to assess whether Apple\u2019s climbing R&D spending is being put to good use. The company is notoriously, mostly understandably secretive about what it\u2019s cooking up in its gadget labs. In the past, Apple has developed crucial innovations in-house, both highly visible ones like iPhones and iPads and less-celebrated innovations such as Apple's line of self-developed computer chips. Now the company may be splurging on areas such as health care, transportation, new forms of computing and more. It\u2019s always tough to assess the return on R&D investment, and it\u2019s doubly hard for Apple.\n\nApple\u2019s rising research-and-development tab isn\u2019t a problem now, and it may never be. The company has found clever ways to keep boosting its revenue even as smartphone sales stall across the industry. Apple\u2019s profits and cash flow continue to pile up, and they are the envy of the corporate world.\n\nWhen a company stumbles, however, spending that once seemed like the standard cost of doing business can come under a microscope. When an activist investor came after Qualcomm a few years ago, it questioned whether the chipmaker should cut its R&D spending to improve profits. If Apple hits a growth wall in coming years, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the company facing similar calls to justify its climbing research-and-development bills.\n\nThere\u2019s a disconnect between the investment narrative about Apple and its profit reality. Wall Street has been excited about the growing share of company revenue coming from its services segment, which includes app sales and Apple Music subscriptions. Those are billed as higher-margin businesses, but because of Apple\u2019s spending the company\u2019s margins have actually been decreasing. Even as investors stare at those 12 zeros in Apple\u2019s market value, it\u2019s tough to argue that the company deserves an even richer valuation, as long as those margins stay squeezed.", "sentiment": 0.2595867924528303, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Honey, I Shrunk Apple\u2019s Profit Margins"}, {"published": "2018-07-27T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-27/bitcoin-rises-from-lows-as-sec-commissioner-keeps-etf-hope-alive?srnd=etfcenter", "text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 2:20 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nCryptocurrency traders don\u2019t know who to believe in the long-running battle to create an exchange-traded fund that invests in Bitcoin.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fueled a slump in the virtual currency by rejecting plans to list such a fund, Bitcoin rallied as Commissioner Hester Peirce expressed support for cryptocurrency ETFs in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. Peirce dissented from the SEC decision on Thursday.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s roller-coaster ride follows a frenzy of speculation on the prospects for an ETF that\u2019s helped the largest virtual currency rise more than 30 percent since the start of July. Those hopes turned to disappointment on Thursday when the SEC denied an exchange\u2019s request to list a cryptocurrency ETF run by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss for a second time. At least four other companies are still awaiting decisions on whether their Bitcoin funds can list.\n\n\u201cThis is a big shot across the bow for those seeking to launch digital currency exchange-traded products,\u201d said Barry Pershkow, a partner at Chapman & Cutler LLP who used to work at the SEC. \u201cYou don\u2019t write 92 pages and undertake serious economic analysis unless you\u2019re trying to make a really important statement.\u201d\n\nLong Haul\n\nOther listing applications will likely be denied on similar grounds or pulled by the exchanges, he said, adding it\u2019ll likely take two or three years for someone to try to address the commission\u2019s concerns.\n\nBut the SEC\u2019s decision didn\u2019t damp traders\u2019 enthusiasm for long. After slipping to as low as $7,793.02 on Friday, Bitcoin rebounded past $8,000 as Peirce detailed why she supported a Bitcoin ETF on Bloomberg Radio.\n\n\u201cAs regulators, our rule is not to judge the value of what an investment is, it\u2019s to give people the opportunity to make those judgments themselves,\" Peirce said on the Bloomberg Markets AM show. The proposed fund \u201cwould allow institutions to play a bigger role in the Bitcoin market, which I think would be good for the market and be good for retail investors as well.\"\n\nPeirce was the only commissioner to vote in favor of allowing the Winklevoss fund; SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and the agency\u2019s two other commissioners all voted to block the listing request.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins will see if the third time is the charm, saying in a statement Thursday that they plan to continue to work with the SEC and are committed to winning approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Lisa Abramowicz", "sentiment": 0.17006, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Bitcoin Bounces as Traders Seek Silver Lining in SEC ETF Denial"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2018-08-02/PCUFLN6KLVR401", "text": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.", "sentiment": 0.3818, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u4e0b\u843d\u3067\u53cd\u5fdc\uff0d\u82f1\u4e2d\u9280\u306e\u697d\u89b3\u7684\u306a\u898b\u901a\u3057\u3001\u5e02\u5834\u3092\u7d0d\u5f97\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u305a"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2018-08-02/PCUN7VSYF01S01", "text": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.", "sentiment": 0.3818, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u9078\u6319\u4ecb\u5165\u3001\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\uff11\u3064\u3067\u53ef\u80fd\u30fc\u7c73\u56fd\u5bb6\u60c5\u5831\u9577\u5b98\u304c\u8b66\u544a"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2018-08-02/PCTPIF6S972G01", "text": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.", "sentiment": 0.3818, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u304d\u3087\u3046\u306e\u56fd\u5185\u5e02\u6cc1\uff08\uff18\u6708\uff12\u65e5\uff09\uff1a\u682a\u5f0f\u3001\u50b5\u5238\u3001\u70ba\u66ff\u5e02\u5834"}, {"published": "2018-07-26T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-26/sec-rejects-winklevoss-twins-request-to-launch-bitcoin-etf?srnd=etfcenter", "text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:43 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nBitcoin fell after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a request to list an exchange-traded fund run by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, showing the regulator remains skeptical that the market for the cryptocurrency is sufficiently free of abuse to bring trading to the masses.\n\nThe SEC said Thursday it isn\u2019t convinced that trading of the world\u2019s largest virtual token has adequate surveillance and that Cboe Global Markets Inc., which would have listed the Bitcoin ETF, failed to show that the underlying market was \"resistant to manipulation.\" The ETF\u2019s value would have been tied to trading on the Winklevoss twins\u2019 Gemini exchange.\n\nIn rejecting the Cboe\u2019s proposal for a second time in 18 months, the SEC raised concerns about the reliability of trading and volume data for Bitcoin, according to a filing posted on the regulator\u2019s website. The agency\u2019s staff specifically called into question the ability of Bitcoin exchanges to sufficiently police trading.\n\nBitcoin had been rising recently in part on speculation that the SEC would sign off on an ETF. The regulator\u2019s decision is a major setback for Bitcoin enthusiasts, because an ETF would have opened up the market to mutual funds and other institutional investors that are restricted from trading the token.\n\nBitcoin fell by as much as 3.6 percent after the SEC\u2019s announcement to $7,848.46. That\u2019s almost 60 percent below the high of $19,511 reached in December.\n\n\"The record before the commission indicates that a substantial majority of Bitcoin trading occurs on unregulated venues overseas that are relatively new and that, generally, appear to trade only digital assets,\" the SEC said in its filing. \"Regulated Bitcoin-related markets are in the early stages of their development.\"\n\nCboe President and Chief Operating Officer Chris Concannon said the exchange took market stability and security \"very seriously.\"\n\n\"Given U.S. investors are clearly already accessing these unregistered financial products, we also believe that investors are better served by products traded on a regulated securities market and protected by robust securities laws,\" he said in a statement. Cboe would continue to work with the SEC on winning approval for a crypto ETF, Concannon added.\n\n\u201cDespite today\u2019s ruling, we look forward to continuing to work with the SEC and remain deeply committed to bringing a regulated Bitcoin ETF to market and building the future of money,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss said in a statement.\n\nBack when the SEC first rejected a proposal to list an ETF backed by the Winklevoss twins in March 2017, the regulator raised similar concerns that exchanges wouldn\u2019t be able to conduct adequate oversight. Many traders had assumed that the subsequent listing of Bitcoin futures contracts on markets run by Cboe and CME Group Inc. would resolve some of the regulator\u2019s concerns.\n\n\"Because Bitcoin markets are still evolving in significant ways, and because there is no comprehensive data source reflecting Bitcoin trading, it is not currently possible to state with confidence what share of volume any particular spot trading venue has captured or will capture,\" the SEC wrote Thursday.\n\nThe SEC is considering several other applications for crypto ETFs, which could still be approved. The Cboe also can appeal the agency\u2019s decision in federal court. However, the SEC indicated it remains concerned that crypto markets aren\u2019t mature enough to support an ETF. SEC commissioners opposed the Cboe\u2019s request in a 3-1 vote.\n\nIn the lone dissent, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that by rejecting a Bitcoin ETF, the regulator might actually undermine investor protections. That\u2019s because doing so prevents the market from becoming more institutionalized, she said.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision \u201csends a strong signal that innovation is unwelcome in our markets,\u201d Peirce said.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Nick Baker, Lily Katz, and Olga Kharif", "sentiment": 0.1683846153846154, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Winklevoss-Backed Bid for Bitcoin-ETF Rejected by Regulators"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/apple-locks-in-1-trillion-market-value-as-shares-climb-chart", "text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE :22 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nApple Inc. shares climbed 3 percent on Thursday, pushing it above $1 trillion in market capitalization, the first U.S. company to reach the milestone.

The move for a higher tariff, which was announced Wednesday, is intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands that China make structural changes to its economy and narrow the U.S. trade deficit. The negotiations broke down last month.\n\nNo Blackmail\n\nChina\u2019s government vowed to strike back against further U.S. actions and said \u201cblackmailing\u201c attempts would fail.\n\n\u201cChina is fully prepared and will have to retaliate to defend the nation\u2019s dignity and the interests of the people, defend free trade and the multilateral system, and defend the common interests of all countries,\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Thursday on its website.

The Trump administration already slapped duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month, which prompted immediate retaliation from China, and another $16 billion will likely follow in the coming days or weeks.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has cited escalating trade disputes as a growing downside risk that\u2019s threatening the strongest global economic upswing in seven years.\n\nRoss said on Thursday that imposing U.S. tariffs on what would add up to about half of all Chinese imports, which were valued at more than $500 billion last year, won\u2019t cause a major economic upheaval.\n\nA 25 percent levy \u201con $200 billion, if it comes to pass , is $50 billion a year,\u201d said Ross on Thursday. \u201c$50 billion a year on a $18 trillion economy\u201d is a fraction of a percent, he said, adding \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe administration last month released a list of thousands Chinese products it wants to slap with an additional 10 percent in tariffs, ranging from television components to handbags and seafood to baseball gloves.

Even Warren Buffett is impressed. \u201cIt is an unbelievable company,\u201d the legendary investor and Apple stockholder said in May as he marveled that Apple earns almost twice as much as the second-most profitable company in the U.S.\n\nBuffett is right. Apple reported $68 billion in profit before taxes and non-operating items in the last year. In distant second place is JPMorgan Chase & Co. with $39 billion in operating profit.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t another tale of Apple\u2019s impossible-to-believe profit power, because Apple isn\u2019t the powerhouse that it used to be.\n\nApple is now a tale of incredibly shrinking profit margins. Apple generates less profit from each dollar of sales than it did in 2010, when it was worth one-quarter as much. Investors most likely won\u2019t care as long as Apple keeps growing and as long as it continues to churn out eye-popping earnings on an absolute basis. But the slimming margins are a potential warning sign as Apple hits the $1 trillion mark, which reflects investor expectations of fat profits for years to come.\n\nThe biggest reason for the profit margin diet is Apple\u2019s spending. Its operating costs have increased at twice the rate of revenue in the last five years, and the company doesn\u2019t detail why. Growth is coming from different sources, too, notably iPhone price increases and sales of ancillary products. Those changes are giving Apple a fundamentally different financial look, and investors haven\u2019t yet been forced to confront how much this altered Apple should be worth.\n\nMargin Call Apple's operating profit margins are at their lowest point since 2009 Source: Bloomberg\n\nApple\u2019s shifting profit character is dramatic. In the 12 months ended in June, Apple generated 26.6 cents of profit from its business operations for each dollar of sales. That was the lowest operating profit margin since 2009, Bloomberg data show. As a share of revenue, its free cash flow \u2014 the net cash generated by its business minus costs of big-ticket projects such as manufacturing equipment and corporate facilities \u2014 is also near its lowest point since 2009.\n\nEven relative to other corporate titans, Apple has lost a step. Five years ago, Apple ranked 40th among companies in the S&P 500 Index by its annual operating profit margins, according to Bloomberg data. Now the company stands 113th. Apple is squeezing lower profits per dollar than the energy drink company Monster Beverage.\n\nRoll Call More than 100 companies in the S&P 500 have higher profit margins than Apple. A selection: Source: Bloomberg\n\nThe reason for the margin squeeze isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s release of more products packed with expensive parts and technology. Although several key iPhone components are costing Apple more , the company\u2019s total revenue minus the basic costs to make its products hasn\u2019t budged much. The biggest cause of Apple\u2019s shrinking margins is its research and development costs.\n\nFive years ago, Apple was spending about $4 billion a year on research and development, or about 3 percent of its sales. On a percentage basis, that was far lower than other U.S. technology companies. In the last 12 months, Apple\u2019s R&D spending amounted to 5.3 percent of its sales. While that\u2019s still low by tech superstar standards, it\u2019s a significant shift for Apple.\n\nSteve Jobs once said that \u201cinnovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have.\u201d Now it seems as if Apple is putting its foot on the R&D gas, hoping it will result in more innovation.\n\nFinding the Future Apple spends 5 percent of its revenue on research and development, a lower percentage than other U.S. tech giants. But the figure has been rising in recent years. Source: Bloomberg\n\nIt\u2019s true that technology investors want and expect technology companies to invest in the future. The U.S. technology titans are in an arms race, battling with engineer hiring and capital spending to build their capabilities in artificial intelligence, driverless cars, cloud computing and other areas they consider crucial to maintain and extend their dominance. In 2015, the investor Carl Icahn wrote that Apple\u2019s rising R&D spending \u201cshould signal to investors that Apple plans to aggressively pursue\u201d growth opportunities.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s tough for outsiders to assess whether Apple\u2019s climbing R&D spending is being put to good use. The company is notoriously, mostly understandably secretive about what it\u2019s cooking up in its gadget labs. In the past, Apple has developed crucial innovations in-house, both highly visible ones like iPhones and iPads and less-celebrated innovations such as Apple's line of self-developed computer chips. Now the company may be splurging on areas such as health care, transportation, new forms of computing and more. It\u2019s always tough to assess the return on R&D investment, and it\u2019s doubly hard for Apple.\n\nApple\u2019s rising research-and-development tab isn\u2019t a problem now, and it may never be. The company has found clever ways to keep boosting its revenue even as smartphone sales stall across the industry. Apple\u2019s profits and cash flow continue to pile up, and they are the envy of the corporate world.\n\nWhen a company stumbles, however, spending that once seemed like the standard cost of doing business can come under a microscope. When an activist investor came after Qualcomm a few years ago, it questioned whether the chipmaker should cut its R&D spending to improve profits. If Apple hits a growth wall in coming years, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the company facing similar calls to justify its climbing research-and-development bills.\n\nThere\u2019s a disconnect between the investment narrative about Apple and its profit reality. Wall Street has been excited about the growing share of company revenue coming from its services segment, which includes app sales and Apple Music subscriptions. Those are billed as higher-margin businesses, but because of Apple\u2019s spending the company\u2019s margins have actually been decreasing. Even as investors stare at those 12 zeros in Apple\u2019s market value, it\u2019s tough to argue that the company deserves an even richer valuation, as long as those margins stay squeezed.", "sentiment": 0.2595867924528303, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Honey, I Shrunk Apple\u2019s Profit Margins"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2018-08-02/PCUDV66S972C01", "text": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.", "sentiment": 0.3818, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u306b\u300c\u5f37\u70c8\u306a\u300d\u5236\u88c1\u3092\uff0d\u7c73\u4e0a\u9662\u8d85\u515a\u6d3e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u304c\u6cd5\u6848\u63d0\u51fa"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2018-08-02/PCTI166S972801", "text": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.", "sentiment": 0.3818, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u731b\u6691\u306e\uff2e\uff39\u306b\u73fe\u308c\u305f\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u6728\u9020\u4f4f\u5b85\u3001\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u5371\u6a5f\u306e\u89e3\u6c7a\u7b56\u306b\u306a\u308b\u304b"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2018-08-02/the-irish-border-vexes-brexit-here-s-what-it-looks-like", "text": "How to keep the Irish border open after the U.K. leaves the European Union has become the trickiest issue in Brexit negotiations.

But now that the Fed is generally raising rates, the rewards don\u2019t appear to be going to them. Instead, I calculate that as much as 83 percent of the gains are going to the banks, with the largest ones sucking up the biggest benefit.\n\nHere\u2019s my math: The nation\u2019s four biggest banks \u2014 Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. \u2014 have just more than $5 trillion in deposits among them. Those deposits, based on the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate, are generating about $94.5 billion a year for the banks, up from $6.3 billion three years ago, before the Fed started raising rates. And that\u2019s before the money they make lending out those deposits. Interest rate disclosures and recent calculations from analysts at KBW, an investment bank that specializes in the financial sector, indicate that those four banks are capturing as much as $73 billion of that $88 billion increase. Depositors\u2019 income has risen just $1.25 billion a month, or $15 billion annually at current rates.\n\nMinimum Deposit Earnings from deposits for the big banks are growing faster than what they are paying customers Source: KBW, Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon alluded to the split in an interview this week with CNBC . Bank investors have been worried that the flattening of the yield curve, which measures the difference between short-term and long-term rates, would squeeze bank profits. And as the Fed raises interest rates, the curve will most likely get even flatter. Dimon said not to worry. His bank, he said, absent a recession, would make a lot more money from higher interest rates regardless of the yield curve. Indeed, JPMorgan\u2019s deposit income is $17.4 billion more than it was making annually in late 2016. The extra income that it is paying depositors has increased only $3.8 billion over the same period.\n\nA few years ago, some analysts and even bank executives argued that depositors would quickly be rewarded with higher income when the Fed raised interest rates. The argument was that fintechs and other startups, like Goldman Sachs\u2019s consumer internet bank, Marcus, as well as the ease of shopping for the best deposit rates online would force the big banks to increase their payouts more quickly than in the past. But that hasn\u2019t happened. According to KBW, deposit betas, which track how fast deposit costs for the banks are rising compared with interest rates, are about half what they were the last time the Fed raised interest rates.\n\nAnd the biggest banks have been able to maintain the lowest deposit rates. KBW calculates that the average rate paid on deposits in the second quarter by what it calls the universal banks, which include the big four as well as State Street Corp. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., was 0.58 percent, compared with 0.79 percent average paid by the nation\u2019s small and midsized banks.\n\nNot Passing Along the Savings The gap between what the big banks pay depositors and the federal funds rate is growing Source: KBW, Bloomberg\n\nThe result is that the spread that the banks pocket between what they pay to depositors and what they receive in interest from the Fed\u2019s guaranteed overnight interest rate has more than tripled over the past year and a half to 1.43 percent from just 0.44 in the last three months of 2016.\n\nOne reason could be technology. Once a customer learns a bank\u2019s mobile app, it may be difficult to switch to another just for a slightly higher return. Or it could be could be the perceived safety of the big banks, which were bailed out by the government in financial crisis. And deposit betas, while still lower than in the past, have started to rise. But the biggest reason is mostly likely simple: size. The nation\u2019s four biggest banks were allowed to get bigger in the financial crisis and have grown, albeit slowly, ever since. That\u2019s most likely given them even more pricing power than before.\n\nPart of President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to boost the economy is to lower regulations on the banks to make them more profitable so they will lend more. And helping the banks tends to trickle down some to borrowers and savers.

The Italian-American automaker rejected an approach from an unnamed Asian parts supplier, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nApollo Global Management and Bain Capital have also expressed interest, according to other people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The division could be valued as high as 6 billion euros in a sale, they said.\n\n\u201cAs previously announced, Fiat Chrysler is pursuing a plan to separate the Magneti Marelli business,\u201d the automaker said in an email. \u201cIn the meantime, as the company has previously indicated, it will evaluate bona fide proposals for alternative transactions.\u201d\n\nApollo declined to comment. Bain didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nFiat Chrysler reversed earlier losses in New York and rose as much as 2.8 percent. The stock traded up 2.5 percent to $17.02 at 1:10 p.m., giving the company a market value of $26.4 billion.\n\nThe decision on Magneti Marelli will be one of the first major moves that Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley makes after taking over the job on July 21 from an ailing Sergio Marchionne, who died last week.\n\nWhile the latest approaches started before Marchionne checked in to a Zurich hospital at the end of June, selling Marelli would help the new leadership extract immediate value for shareholders, including the founding Agnelli family. Simplifying the company would also allow Manley to focus on building and selling cars, and make Fiat Chrysler less complex in the case of any eventual merger talks.\n\nBig Enough Check\n\nFiat Chrysler announced in April that it intended to distribute Magneti Marelli to shareholders by the end of the year, after earlier rebuffing approaches from several suitors. Bloomberg News reported in March that Bain was among the parties expressing interest. Still, at the five-year strategy presentation in June, Marchionne said the carmaker remained open to the unit\u2019s sale if a buyer arrived with a big enough \u201ccheck.\u201d\n\nThat gave suitors an opening to renew their approaches, the people said.\n\nAuto suppliers are contending with a monumental shift toward electric and self-driving cars, which creates opportunities for parts of their portfolio while endangering other areas. Marelli has a mix of low-margin and premium product lines, and the differences are poised to widen amid this transformation.\n\nThe unit, founded in 1919, manufactures automotive lighting systems, powertrain components and engine-control units, along with electronics and suspension systems, shock absorbers and other components and modules. Marelli may boost revenue this year by about 5 percent to 8.9 billion euros, according to an Evercore ISI estimate from April. It\u2019ll earn a profit margin of about 10 percent in 2018, the analysts said.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Sarah Syed", "sentiment": 0.20277727272727278, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Fiat Favors Car-Parts Spinoff Amid New Approaches"}, {"published": "2018-07-29T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-29/the-boj-s-stock-market-distortions-are-coming-under-new-scrutiny?srnd=etfcenter", "text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:38 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nThe Bank of Japan, sometimes dubbed the Tokyo whale for its huge influence on the country\u2019s stock market, may be about to change its habits because it\u2019s taking up too much of the pool.\n\nThat\u2019s the speculation after local press reported that the central bank is considering changing how it buys shares through its exchanged-traded fund program. At its two-day meeting starting Monday, Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s BOJ will discuss reducing investments in ETFs tracking the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, the old blue-chip gauge, because its purchases are having an outsized impact on its companies, the Nikkei newspaper reported last week. Instead, it will buy more funds tracking the broader Topix index, it said.\n\nIf the bank decides to take that step, it\u2019s bad news for the share prices of firms such as Fast Retailing Co., the clothing giant run by Tadashi Yanai, as well as for SoftBank Group Corp. and Fanuc Corp. Those three companies have the heaviest weightings in the Nikkei 225. Fast Retailing\u2019s shares, for example, tumbled 8 percent last week on the news, the worst weekly decline since February, and dragged down the Nikkei 225. Where once the company and the index rode high on the BOJ\u2019s largesse, now they\u2019re already experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent at the close on Monday and Topix slipped 0.4 percent.\n\n\u201cI have always been bitterly critical of the BOJ buying of Nikkei ETFs,\u201d Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA Ltd. in Tokyo said in an interview. In the Nikkei 225, ranking is determined by the arbitrary measure of the price of one share, unlike most share indexes, where market capitalization is key. \u201cBuying of it is hugely distortive.\u201d\n\nInfluenced by the ETF Whale Percent that the BOJ is estimated to own in each company Source: Nomura Holdings Inc.\n\nThe Bank of Japan, which aims to spend 6 trillion yen ($54 billion) a year on ETFs as part of its stimulus program, owned 3.8 percent of the Japanese stock market as of May 28, according to estimates by Nomura Holdings Inc. The bank holds stakes of more than 10 percent in 27 companies, according to the brokerage, including 19 percent of Advantest Corp., 17 percent of Fast Retailing and 16 percent of TDK Corp.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s influence is especially large for companies in the Nikkei 225 that have fewer freely tradable shares, such as Fast Retailing where the billionaire Yanai owns 22 percent, according to CLSA\u2019s Smith. He even asks whether Nikkei Inc. will consider changing the way it calculates the stock gauge to alleviate this issue.\n\n\u201cIt is still continuing to have a disproportionate impact on stocks with small floats and low liquidity,\u201d Smith wrote in a note published Jul. 23. \u201cThe question is whether this will force a change in the way Nikkei constructs its index.\u201d\n\nThe Bank of Japan has already diverted its stock purchases away from the Nikkei 225 once before. In September 2016, shortly after doubling its annual ETF purchase target, the BOJ said it would purchase fewer Nikkei ETFs and more tracking the Topix. But even with the tilt away from Nikkei-linked funds, the issue seems to be persisting.\n\nNow, \u201cshares with higher weighting in Nikkei 225 -- such as Fast Retailing, SoftBank and Fanuc -- are coming under selling pressure,\u201d said Tomoichiro Kubota, an analyst at Matsui Securities Co. in Tokyo. \u201cBut as long as the BOJ keeps the annual amount of ETF purchases unchanged, the overall impact on the market will be limited.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a good chance that the BOJ could introduce some small, technical tweaks at this meeting,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts led by Izumi Devalier said in a report dated July 27. The central bank could rebalance its ETF purchases from the Nikkei 225 to Topix and change its JGB bond-buying operations \u201csuch as widening offer size ranges for its bond purchases and ending the disclosure of bond-buying operation dates.\u201d\n\nWhile speculation is swirling that the BOJ will tweak its ETF program or allow the 10-year bond yield more scope to move beyond zero percent, most investors expect no big policy changes at the meeting. In that, they\u2019re aligned with economists in a recent Bloomberg survey, all 44 of whom predicted no major change to the bank\u2019s settings for its yield-curve control and asset purchase programs.\n\n\u201cObviously there are discussions taking place within the BOJ and there are concerns about the side effects of some of the policies, but I don\u2019t personally think that there will be a change this week,\u201d said Jonathan Allum, a strategist at SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Ltd. in London. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re really in the stage of any great change here.\u201d\n\nBut on the off chance that the BOJ does signal a shift in policy towards tapering, analysts say the market is bound to take it badly. That would be further bad news for a stock market that has already been sputtering for most of 2018. The benchmark Topix index is down more than 7 percent from a high in January, with foreign investors selling a net 3.8 trillion yen ($34.4 billion) in the country\u2019s stocks in the first half.\n\nThe negative impact \"could last longer than expected as the policy is the most relaxed easing policy in history,\" said Hideyuki Suzuki, a general manager at SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. \"There are concerns over whether Japan can handle it as well as the U.S.\"\n\nAnd that wouldn\u2019t be the only problem, according to Mikio Kumada, Hong Kong based global strategist at LGT Capital Partners, who said the negative impact on equities would be long-lasting.\n\n\"It would also undermine the credibility of the BOJ,\" Kumada said. \"The next time we have a recession, or depression or deflation or some kind of Lehman shock, and the BOJ comes out and says, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to aim at 2 percent inflation,\u2019 nobody is going to believe them if they start withdrawing now.\"\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Keiko Ujikane, and Naoto Hosoda", "sentiment": 0.0030303030303030364, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "The BOJ's Stock Market Distortions Are Coming Under New Scrutiny"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-08-02/-russian-oligarch-is-wrong-manafort-judge-is-right", "text": "Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European politics and business.

Justice Elizabeth Gloster of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales noted in a 2012 ruling against one rich Russian, Boris Berezovsky, and in favor of another rich Russian, Roman Abramovich, that calling such people \u201coligarchs\u201d could be inaccurate, even though both were beneficiaries of Russia\u2019s wild transition to capitalism.\n\nShe noted: \u201cThere was some discussion between the historical experts as to whether the use of such term was appropriate, and what it conveyed, but that is not a matter which I need address.\u201d Thus, Gloster satisfied her taste for precision and moved on, since the use of the term cast equal aspersions on both sides at the trial.\n\nIn Manafort\u2019s case, however, the O-word could potentially be applied to players in two widely divergent types of post-Soviet systems \u2014 the Ukrainian one and the the Russian one. The high-flying political consultant worked with representatives of both.

To protect their assets, these people invested in politics and media, and the Yanukovych regime took no important action without consulting with them. The system has been described as crony capitalism because the tycoons behind it received significant rents from the state, but that\u2019s an insufficient description. These wealthy men have also served as a kind of informal government, a variation of the Soviet Politburo, which some Russia experts have conceptualized as the representative organ of an oligarchy.\n\nResearchers have noted that this type of oligarchy persisted in Ukraine after Yanukovych was deposed, under President Petro Poroshenko, who was a minor \u201coligarch\u201d under Yanukovych.\n\nThe Russian system was a bit like the Ukrainian one under President Boris Yeltsin, though the influence of wealthy businessmen was, to a greater extent than in Ukraine, moderated by the power of the law-enforcement agencies and the entrenched bureaucracy.

No Thanks\n\nPresident Donald Trump wants Arab allies to join what is being called an \u201cArab NATO\u201d to fight Iran. Bloomberg\u2019s editors suggest this is a bit much, particularly considering how Arab states are already busy fighting each other and how weak their militaries are. A more realistic goal would be to convince them to work together and put more of their unconventional weapons to use, the editors suggest.\n\nTrump is right, though, to sanction Turkish government officials as punishment for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s refusal to release a U.S. pastor, Bloomberg\u2019s editors write. It\u2019s a risky thing to do to a NATO ally that has lately shown a worrisome predilection to drift into Russia\u2019s orbit. But doing anything less would just encourage more bad behavior by Erdogan.

All the while, Tesla keeps promising that, any day now, it will be able to fund itself \u2013 i.e., not be forced to hit up the stock or bond markets for more money.

It\u2019s been a dramatic turnaround for the former Montreal Expos, who played their first season in the U.S. capital in 2005 and failed to post a winning record until 2012. In the midst of that mediocre stretch, the District of Columbia issued $510 million in ballpark revenue bonds in May 2006.\n\nAt that time, the debt was rated BBB by S&P Global Ratings, just two steps above speculative grade. Analysts said the pledged tax revenue stream was highly dependent on stadium events. Or, as Bloomberg\u2019s municipal-bond guru Joe Mysak put it in his column: Paying stadium bonds is easier if you score more runs. In offering documents, a revenue study made the assumption that \u201cthe future owner(s) of the team will strive to maintain a competitive ball club.\u201d\n\nWell, the Nationals have done more than just that, with winning records in each of the last six seasons. S&P has taken notice, raising its rating on the D.C. stadium bonds this week to A-, following an earlier upgrade in March 2016. Moody\u2019s Investors Service has also boosted the debt since it was issued. That\u2019s a boon for investors like Franklin Resources, which, according to Bloomberg data, has held about $29 million of the bonds since 2009, before the team\u2019s fortunes changed. Invesco appears to have purchased about $31 million of the securities.\n\nThe backdrop of all this, of course, is that public funding for stadiums has become an anathema in recent years. Consider my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Barry Ritholtz\u2019s column from last month, for instance:\n\nYour tax dollars are being wasted, on an enormous scale, by uncompetitive socialist enterprises that ignore the basic rules of economics. I refer, of course, to the practice of politicians who give taxpayer dollars to subsidize the business of sports by paying for the construction and/or renovation of stadiums and arenas. These exercises in crony capitalism make no sense whatsoever. There has never been a decent reason to subsidize these successful businesses, which rarely produce a real return on the public\u2019s investment. Nor is civic pride a justification.\n\nThe way D.C. arranged to back the ballpark bonds is tame in comparison to some of the worst stadium deals. According to S&P, funds come from four sources: rent from the Nationals franchise; stadium taxes on tickets, food, beverages and parking; a utility tax; and a fee levied on businesses in the district that have $5 million or more in annual gross receipts. Largely, it comes down to the team\u2019s performance and whether fans fill the seats.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that winning solves that issue, too. While attendance remained below 2 million from 2009 to 2011, it jumped to 2.37 million in 2012, when the Nationals went 98-64 and finished first in their division. The team has gone on to average 2.57 million fans per year from 2013 to 2017.\n\nSuccess Fills the Seats The Washington Nationals started to draw more fans in 2012, when they posted a winning record Source: ESPN\n\nNot all sports financing happens to coincide with a team\u2019s turnaround. As Bloomberg News\u2019s Amanda Albright reported earlier this week, ice rink projects are responsible for some of the rare defaults in the $3.8 trillion muni market precisely because they often depend on ticket sales and rental revenue to repay their debts. The Atlanta Braves have been known to rope small towns into bidding wars for their minor-league franchises. Sometimes, the cities pledge to cover shortfalls with their general fund revenue. That\u2019s led to credit downgrades, not upgrades.\n\nThe upward trajectory of the ballpark bonds\u2019 ratings, then, should be viewed in isolation, rather than as a verdict on stadium financing as a whole. As Mysak wrote in 2006, consultants concocted a chart of ballpark-related sales growth that \u201cmight be termed the \u2018happily ever after\u2019 projections.\u201d Basically, that proceeds increase at a steady pace year after year.\n\nWell, sometimes happily ever after comes true. \u201cWe base the upgrade on a track record of strong and stable revenues, well in excess of debt service, providing flexibility to prepay existing principal and resulting in improved coverage levels,\u201d S&P analyst Timothy Barrett wrote in a July 31 report.\n\nIndeed, a good chunk of the debt has already matured or D.C. has taken it out. More will be called at 100 cents on the dollar in a month (the securities are selected by lottery, according to Bloomberg). Even so, a smattering of bonds changed hands over the past two weeks at a price above par, speaking to investor demand.\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, enter the home stretch of the season five games behind the division-leading Philadelphia Phillies, and a similar distance from the top of the NL wild-card race. They\u2019ve won twice this week at home, including a dominant 25-4 victory over the New York Mets that set a new team scoring record.\n\nThat kind of scoring will certainly keep the bond payments flowing.", "sentiment": 0.14295714285714287, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Washington Nationals Win Fans in the Bond Market"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/apple-becomes-first-u-s-company-to-hit-1-trillion-market-value", "text": "LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:34 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nApple Inc. became the first U.S.-based company with a market value of $1 trillion, four decades after it was co-founded by Steve Jobs in a Silicon Valley garage and later revolutionized the worlds of computing, music and mobile communications.\n\nThe shares rose 2.9 percent to close at $207.39 in New York on Thursday, propelling the consumer-technology giant\u2019s market value to $1.002 trillion. PetroChina Co. briefly crossed the trillion-dollar mark in late 2007, but slumped quickly as oil prices collapsed in the financial crisis. Other tech giants are not far behind Apple today, with Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. worth more than $800 billion each.\n\nBloomberg Graphic: Follow Apple\u2019s long and winding road to $1 trillion.\n\nSteve Jobs with the iPod Nano on Sept. 5, 2007. Photographer: Ryan Anson/Bloomberg\n\nRead more: A Look at Apple\u2019s Trillion-Dollar World\n\nSince its inception in 1976, Apple has consistently re-imagined what a computer can be and defined how humans interact with devices and software. The iMac desktop computer, the iPod, iPhone, and iPad were smash hits, while commercial misses like the Newton and Lisa are still considered pioneering.\n\n\"Steve\u2019s vision was grounded in the synergy between hardware products, software services, and third-party apps and media to make sure any customer would have everything they need without ever leaving the Apple ecosystem,\" said Tony Fadell, who worked closely with Jobs to create the iPod digital music player.\n\n\"Layered on top of that business model, you had unparalleled product innovation, marketing excellence, combined with an untouchable retail experience,\" Fadell added. \"There isn\u2019t another company out there that executes at Apple\u2019s level of detail, at their fit-and-finish. This trinity established Steve\u2019s vision and created the Apple we know today.\"\n\nBrad Stone: Apple\u2019s Trillion-Dollar World\n\nWhen Jobs introduced the iPhone in early 2007, its touch screen, built-in music player, web browser and email capabilities started the smartphone revolution and left competitors like Motorola and BlackBerry in the digital dust. The iPhone surpassed almost all early expectations, selling more than 1.3 billion units. It spawned the app economy, where a global army of independent developers earn a living from their software creations while increasing the utility of the device. It\u2019s now the hub for a growing services business that the company hopes will pull in $50 billion in revenue a year by 2021.\n\nTim Cook Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Apple was a very different company. Jobs left in 1985 after disagreements with then-CEO John Sculley and the board. By 1997, the company was close to bankruptcy. Jobs returned and, with key lieutenants like design head Jony Ive and operations chief Tim Cook, saved Apple and turned it into the giant it is today. Jobs cut the number of Apple products so they could all fit on a small table, bringing a knack for whittling away extraneous offerings that weren\u2019t up to scratch.\n\nShira Ovide: Honey, I Shrunk Apple\u2019s Profit Margins.\n\nRead more: Apple Is the First Trillion Dollar Company. Do You Know What Else Is Worth That Much?\n\nApple faced another crisis when Jobs died in 2011 and investors worried the company couldn\u2019t thrive without his intense, hands-on product-design leadership. However, Cook has overseen the development of key new products, like the iPhone X and Apple Watch, new services like Apple Music, and research on potential new categories like self-driving cars and augmented-reality glasses.\n\nApple was worth about $350 billion when Jobs died, so Cook has led the creation of even more stock-market value than his former boss and mentor. Bloomberg News asked him about the $1 trillion target in a February interview.\n\n\"I don\u2019t really think about it,\" he said, suggesting that if the company keeps making successful products, financial success will follow. \"I still view Apple as a pretty small company, the way that we operate. I know it\u2019s not numerically, but the way we function is very much like that.\"\n\nWanna play a game? See what else is worth $1 trillion.\n\nWhile tapping his experience working with Jobs, and relying on the co-founder\u2019s advice, Cook has brought his own skills and strategies to the CEO position. Jobs was a maniacal manager who focused on the smallest product components. Cook relies heavily on his suite of experienced managers.\n\nJobs often presented nearly the entirety of Apple\u2019s launch events, while Cook typically emcees, but hands product announcements to lieutenants like marketing head Phil Schiller, software chief Craig Federighi, and services lead Eddy Cue.\n\n\"Tim and team have done a masterful job of continuing to develop Steve\u2019s vision while bringing operational and environmental excellence to every part of Apple\u2019s business to achieve their unheard-of scale while continuing to grow unprecedented margins in the consumer electronics business,\u201d Fadell said.\n\niPhone X Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\nJobs was averse to debt, possibly a hangover from Apple\u2019s near-brush with bankruptcy. After the iPhone, profit soared and a huge cash pile grew. Cook tackled that by borrowing vast quantities of money, making Apple one of the largest corporate bond issuers. He then used some of the cash on an unprecedented program of buybacks and dividends that has returned more than $275 billion to shareholders since 2012.\n\nCook also partly reversed Jobs\u2019 product focus, adding wireless earphones, watches, a speaker and several versions of the iPhone. The latter move has helped the company maintain smartphone growth in an industry that\u2019s now contracting.\n\nHe also catapulted Apple into new areas of politics, tech industry policy and environmental responsibility. He has pushed suppliers to improve labor practices and battled with U.S. authorities over user-privacy tools like encryption.\n\n\u201cThe odds are stacked firmly against any new leader taking the CEO reins from a founder,\" Fadell said. \"Tim has deftly proven otherwise.\u201d\n\nCook\u2019s tenure hasn\u2019t been without its challenges. The company faced a backlash when it replaced Google Maps on the iPhone with a buggy and unreliable Apple Maps app in 2012. It also stopped work on its own car to take on Tesla Inc., and faced criticism earlier this year when it was discovered the company throttled iPhone processing speeds to avoid shutdowns from aging batteries.\n\nApple hit the $1 trillion milestone in the wake of a new U.S. tax law that\u2019s been a boon for shareholders. The company\u2019s corporate tax rate was slashed and it\u2019s bringing hundreds of billions of overseas dollars back to the country. Much of that money will be spent on more buybacks and dividends.\n\nInvestors are also keenly awaiting a major iPhone overhaul this fall that will include the largest screen size to date and a cheaper model that includes many of the iPhone X\u2019s features.\n\nAbout 11 years after launching, the device represents both the biggest opportunity and challenge for Apple and Cook. Despite surging services revenue, iPhones generated 61 percent of the company\u2019s sales in its last fiscal year, up from 56 percent in 2014.\n\nIf Apple is going to move far beyond $1 trillion, Cook has to find the right combination of future hit hardware products and new services that thrive on those devices.\n\nFor more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Sophie Caronello", "sentiment": 0.17321551724137932, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Apple Becomes First U.S. Company to Hit $1 Trillion Value"}, {"published": "2018-07-26T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-26/hedge-funds-have-never-needed-a-bezos-beat-more-taking-stock?srnd=etfcenter", "text": "SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\n\nStock futures are barely budging relative to the havoc wreaked by Facebook in the tech space. Case in point is the the ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index (QQQ), which is reversing ~1.5% lower in pre-market trade after notching a record high close on Wednesday.\n\nOptimism out of the Trump-Juncker tariff breakthrough meeting may be buoying the broader tape -- it certainly gave a bid to the European automakers (Fiat Chrysler +4.7%, BMW +3%, Daimler +2.2%) -- but the collapse of the NXP Semi/Qualcomm deal shouldn\u2019t be swept aside as just a loss for so many risk arbitrage traders.\n\nMany will see this as an opportunity squandered for a potential peace offering by the Chinese and are in wait-and-see mode until Trump lashes out with more threats. Don\u2019t forget that it was less than a week ago when Trump said he was \"ready to go\" with tariffs on $500 billion of Chinese goods. Plus the trade war with China has been much more of a market mover than anything going on with the EU, so we may all just be biding our time until the next wrench gets thrown.\n\nAnd it\u2019s possible the U.S.-EU agreement isn\u2019t such a great sign anyway, if you go by the latest take from Goldman Chief Economist Jan Hatzius, who says the news isn\u2019t uniformly positive given 1) the lack of specifics in the announcement raises the possibility that the negotiations may falter at a later stage, like the U.S.-China talks earlier this year, and 2) the pact may embolden the White House to use proposed tariffs to try to win concessions from other trading partners, like China. \"Overall, we do not believe that recent positive developments regarding US-EU trade should be interpreted as a reduction in risk in the other major trade dispute, with China. In fact, they likely mean the opposite,\" Hatzius added.\n\nAnd not to mention the flurry of negative reactions to earnings after the bell that have zero to do with Facebook, for example Nokia, PayPal, Spotify, Ford, Knight-Swift, Mohawk, Mattel, Nielsen, and Biogen (more on this in the sector blow-by-blow section).\n\nAmazon Could Make It a FAANG Trifecta\n\nTwo out of the three FAANG earnings have disappointed, but this one stings much more than the other one. If you go by what the options market was pricing in, Facebook\u2019s breakdown was infinitely worse (and more surprising) than Netflix, which ended up falling 5.2% the day after earnings versus an implied move of almost 9%; that compares with Facebook\u2019s current pre-market plunge of ~21% versus options which implied a move of just 5.5%.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know whether this stalls the rally in all-things momentum or acts as another minor bump in the road, like what we saw after Netflix -- the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (ticker MTUM), which is up 25% in the past year and closed at a record yesterday, will be a good indicator -- but recall that we had a brutal reversal in tech earlier this week that collectively puzzled trading pads across the Street, and we now have a painful session ahead of us in the space on the back of Facebook\u2019s letdown.\n\nThe vanilla and hedge-fund longs still heavily exposed in the space need to tread lightly, especially if Amazon comes in below the whispers after the bell Thursday -- the stock is up 59% year-to-date and closed at another record Wednesday, plus almost every sell-sider is gushingly bullish (48 out of 51 analysts rate the stock a buy while zero have it at sell). The Street has gotten used to decent-sized positive reactions, with shares rising 10 of the last 14 earnings days with an average gain of 7.5% versus an average decline of 4.7%.

It is globally regarded by naval officers as the Olympic Games of naval power. Run by the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which is headquartered in Pearl Harbor, it normally includes warships and troops from every branch of the U.S. armed forces, and those of than 20 foreign nations.\n\nAs a junior officer, I participated in several of these huge war games, and found them profoundly important for national security. They have been held since the early 1970s, and include nations not only from the Western Pacific rim \u2014 Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and so on \u2014 but also from the Pacific coast of South America, including Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia.\n\nIndia, an emerging maritime power, had a significant operational role for the first time this year. Several European allies with interests in the Pacific, including the U.K., France and Germany, also send ships. Israel sends a small staff contingent.\n\nSome wags would say that the most important business is done at the big cocktail parties, and that the most dangerous moments are the photo shoots at sea (where the huge fleets come together undertaking very precise and scary formations, with the added degree-of-difficulty of challenging language barriers).\n\nBut in truth, RIMPAC is an incredibly important opportunity to for allies together to practice complex maneuvers: amphibious landings, long-range aircraft strikes, counterpiracy, antisubmarine warfare, counterterrorism, anti-air missile shoots, and humanitarian responses to large natural disasters.\n\nIt is also, above all, a visible signal of the most important militaries of the vast Pacific Basin being willing to share training, tactics and technology. With some 50 ships from a couple of dozen nations sharing and learning from each other, the opportunities to improve warfighting capability are rich. We are able to exercise our powerful tactical ballistic-missile submarines, which can launch Tomahawk missiles. And through exercises like this we can also find the best way to operate our new Littoral Combat Ships \u2014 frigate-sized warships capable of working in relatively shallow seas \u2014 in tight regional conflict.\n\nBut this year, in a break with recent tradition, China was \u201cdisinvited\u201d in May because of its militarization of a variety of artificial islands in the volatile South China sea, where it is sending troops and setting up combat-aircraft, runways and missile systems. There was also a distinct undercurrent of opposition to China\u2019s presence by the Donald Trump administration, which sensibly criticizes Beijing for trade practices and theft of intellectual property.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve repeatedly criticized Trump for his dealings with allies and foes, cutting Beijing \u201cout of the pattern\u201d this year was the right decision. It deprived China of not only the chance to observe and learn about allied naval practices, but also of the prestige of engaging with the top navies in the world. The increasing involvement of India \u2014 the obvious strategic counterweight to China \u2014 as well as this year\u2019s addition of Vietnam \u2014 a growing naval actor deeply concerned about Chinese dominance in the South China Sea \u2014 sends a powerful signal.\n\nAll of this underlines how important military exercises are to our ability project power; maintain sea control (and therefore ensure shipping lanes around the world remain open); and exert influence on allies, friends and partners. It also shows why Trump\u2019s decision to stop U.S. military exercises with South Korea \u2014 in return for a few vague promises from North Korea \u2014 is a bad idea.\n\nSuch military exercises have three principal functions, and RIMPAC is at the top level of such events:\n\nFirst, they provide a strategic context to our overall policies in a given region, and no region is probably more critical than the Western Pacific. This is all the more vital because the Trump administration made a significant mistake by pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Leaving aside the economic issues attendant to that call, it was a major geopolitical foot fault. We can mitigate some of the damage that decision inflicted on our leadership role in the region by conducting robust, meaningful exercises like RIMPAC \u2014 while excluding China.\n\nSecond, warfighting \u201cpractice sessions\u201d give us real insight into not just allied military capabilities, but also those of adversaries. They help reveal the surveillance and intelligence-gathering abilities of opponents like China: how capable they are and what their evaluation of us is all about. That is prime-grade intelligence.\n\nThird and finally, RIMPAC is a \u201ccarrot\u201d that over time may be applied to China. If we are to avoid the Thucydides Trap, which holds that war between the dominant power and a rising rival is inevitable \u2014 we will need a strategy over time to offer China opportunities to be included in meaningful security cooperation. Perhaps we missed such a chance with Russia at the end of the Cold War, possibly leading to Vladimir Putin\u2019s adventurism today. If we can dissuade Beijing from continuing unacceptable behavior in cyber, the South China Sea and intellectual property theft, the situation may become less fraught in the long throw.\n\nOverall, this year\u2019s exercises were a resounding strategic success, and a tactical treasure trove of information.

With anxiety building over the growth implications as the U.S. and China exchange threats over trade, emerging-market currencies stand to suffer, while the dollar\u2019s haven status attracts flight-to-quality flows, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen there are worries about trade, the dollar gets bid because there\u2019s fears that this could lead to a bigger slowdown globally,\u201d said Caron, who helps oversee $80 billion in fixed-income assets. \u201cIt does counter what effectively Trump would want, which is better terms of trade.\u201d\n\nCaron has been reducing his portfolio\u2019s dollar underweight this year to reflect that haven dynamic, although he expects the currency to resume weakening over the next one-to-two years.\n\nDay of Dominance\n\nThe yuan has now depreciated almost 5 percent this year against the dollar. In addition to dominating emerging-market currencies Thursday, the greenback gained against nearly all of its Group-of-10 peers as well -- the yen, a haven play, was the most resilient in the face of greenback strength.\n\nThe yuan slid even as the People\u2019s Bank of China set the currency\u2019s reference rate against the dollar stronger, after several days of weaker levels. The discrepancy suggests traders and investors are bidding up the dollar rather than an attempt by Chinese policymakers to weaken the yuan, said Sacha Tihanyi, an emerging-market strategist at TD Securities.\n\nTihanyi also expects the greenback to climb, counter to the U.S. president\u2019s wishes, as trade barbs unnerve financial markets. While Trump would like to increase America\u2019s trade competitiveness, it\u2019s difficult to achieve that while concern over a global slowdown drives investors into the dollar, Tihanyi said.\n\n\u201cIf there were no concern about global trade policy and how that could affect global growth dynamics, it\u2019s likely that the dollar would be much softer than it is right now because investors would be more risk-loving,\u201d Tihanyi said.", "sentiment": 0.09554285714285714, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "To Trump's Chagrin, Trade Standoff Helps Power Dollar Higher"}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/fidelity-to-offer-index-mutual-funds-with-zero-expense-ratio?srnd=etfcenter", "text": "Terms of Service Violation\n\nYour usage has been flagged as a violation of our terms of service.\n\nFor inquiries related to this message please contact support.

He provoked an uproar at the July summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki by casting doubt on U.S. intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have found that Russia in 2016 launched an effort to hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and ultimately to help Trump win.

Turkey's real policy rate is headed back to where it was before tightening Source: Bloomberg, Turkstat\n\nTurkey remains particularly exposed to shifts in investor sentiment, given its large external financing needs. The lira has shed more than a fifth of its value this year against the dollar as capital inflows slowed to a trickle, hampering the ability of companies to repay foreign-currency loans and fueling inflation.\n\nThe lira, bonds and stocks extended their slide after the U.S. imposed sanctions on two government ministers over the detention of an evangelical pastor. The currency fell 1.4 percent to 5.0664 as of 12:05 p.m. in New York after plunging as much as 2 percent to an all-time low of 5.0930 against the dollar.\n\nThe yield on 10-year debt bonds jumped 89 basis points to a record 19.48 percent. The benchmark share index dropped as much as 3.2 percent, bringing its loss this year to 18 percent, the worst performance in the world in local currency terms. The iShares MSCI Turkey ETF dropped 2.2 percent.\n\n\u201cThe market lurches from one negative event to another,\u201d said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors in London. \u201cThe net result being the erosion of foreign appetite for Turkish assets and an ever weaker lira.\u201d\n\nBehind the Curve\n\nAfter months of inaction in the face of double-digit price growth, the central bank boosted borrowing costs by 500 basis points starting in April -- but the move came too late. Economists estimate consumer prices jumped more than 16 percent in July, a pace that effectively drives inflation-adjusted policy rates down to levels seen at the end of last year and leaves the nation\u2019s assets exposed to the ebbs and flows of foreign capital.\n\n\u201cThe central bank has remained behind the curve,\u201d said Alp Serbetli, a currency trader at Anadolubank AS in Istanbul. \u201cThe market is currently pricing that risk premiums and inflation will further increase and that the central bank will be forced to hike more.\u201d\n\nInflation Outlook\n\nGovernor Murat Cetinkaya said Tuesday that the central bank held off on another rate hike last week because economic growth was seen to be slowing, and that he wants to see the lagged impact of past increases. Still, market pricing suggests the inflation outlook is only going to get worse if the monetary authority hesitates further on tightening policy soon.\n\nA report due Friday will show consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 16.3 percent in July, according to the median estimate in Bloomberg survey. That would push down the central bank\u2019s main policy rate to less than 2 percent after adjusting for price growth. The central bank next meets on Sept. 13.\n\nThe one-year dollar-lira currency swap rate jumped to the biggest premium on record to the three-month contract after the central bank unexpectedly refrained from raising rates on July 24 -- a sign that investors are demanding more compensation for longer-dated securities to protect themselves against an acceleration in price growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging-market research at TD Securities in London. \u201cDiplomacy has never been that bad in many years, the economy is slowing and there\u2019s a concrete risk of a hard landing; from a financial viewpoint, the central bank will be forced to hike again unless the upside dollar-lira move reverses, but I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Aline Oyamada", "sentiment": -0.044145833333333336, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Turkey's Markets Plunge Into the Unknown After U.S. Sanctions"}, {"published": "2018-07-25T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-25/rapture-reconsidered-how-markets-have-changed-since-winter-rout?srnd=etfcenter", "text": "Terms of Service Violation\n\nYour usage has been flagged as a violation of our terms of service.\n\nFor inquiries related to this message please contact support.

But for Jon von Tetzchner it\u2019s ground well-trodden.\n\nThe Norwegian entrepreneur co-founded the company that developed the Opera web browser in the mid-1990s \u2013 then competing with Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer, and industry leader Netscape Navigator \u2013 which made its debut on the Nasdaq Global Select Market last week.\n\nAfter leaving in 2011, when Google\u2019s Chrome had already taken about a quarter of the global market, he set up Vivaldi Technologies AS in 2014, hired former Opera staff, and built a new web browser to plug a gap he felt his previous creation no longer filled.\n\n\u201cOpera had gone in a different direction,\u201d von Tetzchner said. \u201cAfter I left the company, they basically threw away the code and decided to kind of start fresh and go the same direction as everyone else, making browsers that were more limited.\u201d\n\nLimited aesthetically, perhaps. But underneath, modern web browsers have morphed into powerful and crucial gateways to the world\u2019s digital information that generate billions of dollars in annual revenue. Google built an operating system, Chrome OS, based on the idea that a browser can run complex software programs only supported by powerful computers in the past. Apple\u2019s Safari and Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browsers can also handle bulky tasks like streaming video, file-transfer management, digital photo editing, and 3-D video games.\n\nThese platforms let users add new features by downloading third-party extensions to add even more functionality, such as advanced privacy controls, bargain-finding shopping tools, and language translation. But with mainstream browsers prioritizing accessibility over the inclusion of advanced built-in feature sets, von Tetzchner said, the opportunity exists to be unique in the market with increased out-of-the-box functionality.\n\n\u201cWe put in anything that our users ask for,\u201d he said. What happens a lot with other browsers, he said, \u201cis that anything that isn't getting a significant amount of use gets removed, and eventually you end up with very limited products because of that. Our thinking is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s Chrome browser used to have a built-in app store, but Google removed that feature in 2017 after saying in 2016 that only about 1 percent of desktop users took advantage of it, and that standard web technologies had progressed to the point that rendered them less necessary. In contrast, Vivaldi has added features not commonly seen in competing applications, such as the ability to control Philips Hue smart lightbulbs directly from the software.\n\nBuilding a browser that grabs even a sliver of the market can be highly lucrative. That gives Vivaldi a chance. Search engines, and Google in particular, pay to be the default when people launch with browser. It\u2019s big business: Google accounted for 43 percent of Opera\u2019s 2017 operating revenue of $128.9 million. Vivaldi also charges some businesses to be featured as default \u201cbookmarks,\u201d meaning their websites are presented to new users as suggested destinations when the open the browser.\n\nVon Tetzchner is confident his experience in the market gives Vivaldi leverage. A recent legal decision could help, too. In July, Google was handed a $5 billion antitrust fine from the European Commission for strong-arming Android device makers into pre-installing its search engine and Chrome browser on their gadgets. The regulator ordered Google to stop the practice. This gives other browsers the chance to be the default when people pick up their smartphones to go online.\n\n\u201cIt's really positive that the commission is looking at those things,\u201d von Tetzchner said.\n\nWhen the EU settled with Microsoft in 2009 over the company\u2019s bundling of Internet Explorer browser with the Windows operating system, Microsoft agreed to let consumers choose which browser to install. Google Chrome\u2019s success has been linked to this regulatory action, by some in the internet business.\n\n\u201cIt impacted their behavior for a while,\u201d von Tetzchner said of the case. \u201cI think that's probably more important than anything.\u201d\n\nVivaldi doesn\u2019t yet have a mobile version of its browser, but von Tetzchner said it\u2019s being developed.", "sentiment": 0.16861333333333337, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Competing With Google Isn\u2019t Scary When You\u2019ve Done It Before"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2018-08-02/PCUHSCSYF02C01", "text": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.", "sentiment": 0.3818, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30b9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\uff23\uff25\uff2f\u306e\u8b77\u885b\u8cbb\u7528\u5f15\u304d\u4e0a\u3052\u3001\u5e741000\u4e07\u30c9\u30eb\u3092\u8ffd\u52a0"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/carney-says-he-may-not-be-done-raising-rates-at-bank-of-england", "text": "Terms of Service Violation\n\nYour usage has been flagged as a violation of our terms of service.\n\nFor inquiries related to this message please contact support.

The odds were against him. His opponent was Novak Djokovic, who is the nearest thing that tennis has ever had to a cyborg \u2013 a player who can hit for hours with unnerving exactitude, who never gets tired and who has the ability to bend and stretch himself hydraulically to reach impossibly distant balls. The gulf in experience was significant. The Italian Open is one of the Masters 1000 tournaments, the most prestigious events on the tennis calendar after the four grand slams. Zverev had never competed in a final at this level. Djokovic had played in 44.\n\nAlongside Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, Djokovic is part of the greatest generation of champions tennis has ever seen. They have been dominant for nearly 15 years, winning 53 out of the 63 grand slams held since 2003. No previous cohort of stars has stayed at the top for so long. But though Federer basks in a glorious Indian summer and Nadal has overcome injuries that looked career ruining, the world knows that they are closer to retirement than the peak of their powers. Victory in Rome would make Zverev the youngest player to win a Masters title since Djokovic won in Miami in 2007. It would also propel him into the top ten, something no other 20-year-old has managed since 2008. And it would confirm him as heir-apparent.\n\nThe day was bright but blustery, and as the wind swirled around the steep sides of the stadium it picked up the dry clay covering the court and filled the air with a pinkish haze. Zverev seemed unperturbed. Receiving Djokovic\u2019s serve in the opening game, he applied himself aggressively, hitting hard, flat and deep, rushing Djokovic across the baseline. Before anyone knew it, he was up 15-40. Hoping to arrest Zverev\u2019s progress, Djokovic spun a serve out wide to drag his opponent towards the advertising hoardings. Zverev was alert to it, moving early and hitting it on the rise cross-court. The ball\u2019s pace and line-dusting accuracy took Djokovic by surprise and forced him to lunge with a deep, heaving groan. He got barely half a racket to it, and the ball trickled pathetically into the net. Zverev, his hair restrained by an orange headband, three gold chains round his neck glinting in the sunshine, loped to the chair with a languid swagger.\n\nZverev is not always so calm. He has been known to charge towards an umpire whom he disagrees with yelling \u201cYou fucking moron!\u201d and to smash up a racket before stamping on its sorry remains just to make sure. Then again, he has also embraced linesmen, pecked ball girls on the cheek and joshed with spectators. But that afternoon in Rome he was quiet and concentrated. When it was his turn to serve, he walked to the baseline looking placidly at the crowd, bounced the ball four times and tossed. Zverev\u2019s service action is long and slow: when his knees bend low, his head leans back and his throwing arm reaches into the air with fingers splayed, he looks like one of the distended figures in an El Greco painting.\n\nThe speed of Zverev\u2019s serve, which can be upwards of 220kph, is severe but unsurprising. At 6\u20196\u201d (1.98 metres), he is one of the game\u2019s giants, and has all the long-levered advantages that height brings on a tennis court. But to beat Djokovic you have to do more than serve well. Arguably the best returner in history, he can dispatch even the fastest deliveries with a nonchalant swipe, at which point you\u2019d better be prepared to slug it out from the baseline. Zverev likes nothing more. Having served, he generally rallies from a position deep behind the baseline, where he takes enormous swings and controls points with his groundstrokes. He hits off both wings with equal ferocity but it\u2019s his backhand that does the real damage. A flawless double-hander, it is already widely regarded as the best in the world.\n\nAt 3-2 in the first set, Zverev was down 15-30 on his serve. Djokovic looked on the verge of breaking back. But midway through the rally, Zverev launched an assault on Djokovic\u2019s backhand, pushing him deeper and deeper behind the baseline. With his opponent now on the defensive he changed tack and finessed a gentle drop-shot over the net. It spun sideways, died on the clay and left Djokovic standing. Zverev followed it with a wide first serve that leapt away from his opponent, and then another unreturnable one. He was now leading 4-2 and Djokovic had no way back in the first set. \u201cThis guy has greatness written all over him,\u201d said one TV commentator.\n\nGreatness is not necessarily what you\u2019d expect if you looked at Zverev. Among the more striking statistics in men\u2019s tennis \u2013 a sport which we like to think of as being dominated by the tall \u2013 is the fact that no player of Zverev\u2019s height has ever been world number one. Of the 128 grand slams played between 1985 and 2017, only three were won by someone over 6\u20195\u201d. After a certain point the advantages that extra inches offer on serve are counterbalanced by disadvantages returning and rallying, when long limbs and lumbering strides make it difficult to generate the darting movements necessary for a great return game and the speed required to compete in rallies against shorter, more nimble athletes. The last four men to reach the summit of the game \u2013 Federer (6\u20191\u201d), Nadal (6\u20191\u201d), Djokovic (6\u20192\u201d) and Andy Murray (6\u20193\u201d) \u2013 have all occupied a narrow physical range where power, speed and agility are present in equal measure. \u201cHistory has not been kind to tall players,\u201d says Mark Petchey, a former pro who used to coach Murray. \u201cBut Zverev seems different, if I\u2019m honest. The balance he has, the movement he has, it looks stress free.\u201d\n\nEarly in the second set, Djokovic tried to take control by running Zverev from corner to corner in an attempt to knock him off balance. Having served wide to Zverev\u2019s forehand, Djokovic then pulled him to the other side of the court, before repeating the pattern, like a man trying to wear out an indefatigable dog. On clay courts players slide into wide balls, leading with an outstretched foot. They move their weight forward through the shot at the same time as they travel sideways. Most behemoths hate situations like this \u2013 they\u2019re all limbs and no idea \u2013 but Zverev glided gleefully, his heels emitting little sprays of red dirt.\n\nFor a while he was happy to defend, hitting slow, looping balls that gave him time to come to a halt, shift his weight and dash in the opposite direction. But then he changed the pace in an instant, unleashing a backhand heavy with top spin deep into the corner. It landed slightly behind Djokovic, who was forced into reverse. With his weight going backwards all he could manage was a weak return, which landed mid-court, bounced high and got slapped away for a winner. \u201cWe have seen Djokovic turn guys into pretzels during rallies like that,\u201d one TV commentator remarked. Who was the pretzel now?\n\nAs the game wore on, Djokovic\u2019s robotic countenance cracked. At the baseline between points, he began yelling Serbian obscenities, spittle flying. He was annoyed by the breeze, annoyed by bad bounces, annoyed by the apparent conspiracy between his ball and the net. Leading 2-1 in the second set, all Zverev had to do was hold serve and he\u2019d be the champion.\n\nAt 5-3 Djokovic was serving to stay in the match. A few minutes later the scores were tied at deuce. Djokovic\u2019s first serve struck the top of the net, looped up high and went out. He turned to a ball boy, smiled and nodded phlegmatically. On match point, Zverev swayed from side to side with his top lip curled into a faint snarl. The ball was fired down to his forehand, and he leapt to his right to return, then shuffled into position for his next shot. But he didn\u2019t need to: Djokovic\u2019s backhand sailed a foot long. Standing at the back of the court Zverev looked up into the sun and raised his arms in joy and disbelief. Embracing Djokovic at the net, he sunk his head into his opponent\u2019s shoulder and kissed it.\n\nOne cool evening in April, Zverev was practising at the Monte Carlo Country Club, in preparation for the Monte Carlo Masters, the first big clay-court tournament of the 2018 season. The club overlooks the Mediterranean. You can see yachts sailing by and, on the headland, a white mansion that used to belong to Karl Lagerfeld. Since he was 18, Zverev has lived down the road, in a building where his older brother Mischa, another professional tennis player, and his parents Alexander and Irina, also have apartments.\n\nTennis is full of stories of family dysfunction \u2013 Mike Agassi bawling out the infant Andre as he forced him to play; Mary Pierce taking out a restraining order against the father who menaced her to excellence. But the Zverevs present a remarkably harmonious picture, travelling together to tournaments in a style that is both globe-trotting and endearingly domestic. They even take the family dog, a dark-grey poodle called Lovik who has a Louis Vuitton dog carrier and often gets his own tournament pass. \u201cEveryone in the team has their own job,\u201d Mischa says. \u201cMum is taking care of the mum things, Lovik is making sure Sascha is in a good mood when he wakes up, because when you see your dog you\u2019re not going to be in a bad mood. Dad\u2019s the coach. I\u2019m sometimes there if I feel like he needs help, other times I\u2019m just a brother. What do you call it? A household? A factory?\u201d\n\nZverev is compulsive about practice. He has been known to hit balls until well after midnight at tournaments, and at Saddlebrook, the Florida resort where he spends the off-season, floodlights are being installed especially for him so he can carry on training after dark. Today the production line focused on quality control. After an ascendant 2017, during which he\u2019d also beaten Roger Federer in the final of the Canadian Open and risen to world number three, Zverev had started the season horribly. He played indifferently in Rotterdam, Acapulco and Indian Wells, and though he made the final in Miami, his performances were scrappy and error-strewn. His forehand was the big problem \u2013 he had lost range and consistency \u2013 and that evening in Monte Carlo he was working to get it back. At one end of the court Jez Green, Zverev\u2019s bald, burly physical trainer, fed him balls, which he struck metronomically for minutes on end. Each stroke elicited a rough little grunt, until a ball jumped up higher than expected and he dumped it in the net, at which point the grunt became a long sigh of despair. Patrolling quietly behind him was his father, who has coached him since he was a boy. A tubby man with a teddy-bearish face, Zverev Sr mimed minute adjustments to his son\u2019s swing and muttered suggestions.\n\nMidway through the session, Zverev\u2019s mother, who has shoulder-length, greying hair and was wearing a pink and grey T -shirt, sat down in the bleachers with Lovik on her knee. As the dog dozed, she began offering her own snatches of advice. \u201cSash!\u201d she whispered, trying to get her husband\u2019s attention using a diminutive for Alexander, \u201cSash!\u201d Her son was hitting too flat, she thought, and needed more top-spin. Her husband widened his eyes playfully and gestured for her to come down to the court if she thought she could do better. Eventually, with her son resting by the umpire\u2019s chair, she walked on to court and handed him the dog. While he nuzzled the animal, she rootled around in his bag and picked out a fresh T -shirt.\n\nAlexander and Irina were both born in Sochi on Russia\u2019s Black Sea coast, he in 1960, she in 1967. A resort city, it thronged with tourists in the summer months, who packed the promenade, paddled about in pedalos and hiked in the nearby hills. But for Alexander and Irina, there was just one problem: there were no indoor tennis courts.\n\nBoth were fanatical players, and to keep their edge they needed year-long practice. Eventually they moved to the capital, and quickly became fixtures of the national tennis team, training at CSKA Moscow, the sports club run by the Russian military that was affectionately known as the Red Army Club. Irina, who reached a top ranking of number four in the country, was known for the beauty of her one-handed backhand; Alexander, who reached number one, for his physical grace and strategic nous.\n\nCompared with everyone else, life for sports professionals in the Soviet Union was good: they had celebrity and a decent salary; they were at the head of the queue for apartments and cars. But their careers were constrained. The government\u2019s sports committee decided who played where, and took all the prize money. Alexander and Irina were rarely allowed to play matches abroad. Alexander\u2019s comrades on the national team thought he had the potential to be one of the best players of his era. As it was his world ranking never climbed above 175.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, the couple was free to roam, and in 1990 Irina went to Germany to play in a tournament, with Alexander as her coach. Someone offered them jobs at his tennis club. They said no, but the following year he asked again. \u201cWe thought, why not? We\u2019ll try it for a year,\u201d Alexander says. And so, in the early Nineties, they began working at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg\u2019s leafy northern suburbs, living in a one-room apartment with Mischa, who was four when they arrived, and coaching all hours. One year turned into two, and two turned into ten. Eventually they became German citizens.\n\nAlexander, whom everyone calls Sascha, was born in 1997 and grew up breathing tennis. Not only were his parents at the club every day, but his older brother, who had been put through a rigorous training regime by his father, was on the way to becoming the best junior in Germany. Sascha watched Mischa compete in junior tournaments all over the world; other players, with names such as Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, would sometimes entertain him. \u201cNovak and Rafa I have known since I was four years old,\u201d he says. \u201cThey actually tell me the first time they met me, because I can\u2019t remember. They say, \u2018Oh, I remember that junior tournament in Italy. We played, like, mini tennis with you.\u2019\u201d He met Roger Federer at the age of five. \u201cSascha has shown me a photograph of us together at the Hamburg Masters,\u201d Federer says, \u201cso of course I tell him I remember this moment vividly, because he was such a cute, lovely boy.\u201d Zverev asked for his autograph, and was surprised when Federer answered in German; he didn\u2019t know Swiss people spoke German. \u201cSo I got his autograph and he said, \u2018Well, maybe if you work hard, one day we might play against each other somewhere.\u2019\u201d With all the confidence of youth Zverev replied, \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d\n\nHis parents were enthusiastic boosters. Mischa was on a German junior team coached by Boris Becker, a former world number one and three-time Wimbledon champion. \u201cI first saw Sascha when he was five years old,\u201d Becker says, \u201cand the parents said, \u2018Look, Mischa is good, but Sascha is going to be amazing.\u2019\u201d Their hunch was based partly on his natural facility \u2013 \u201cWhen you have kids, you can see what they can do with balls!\u201d Irina says \u2013 and partly on his desperate competitiveness. Every summer he and Mischa would set up a little net in the garden of their home in Hamburg, and play their own version of Wimbledon, marking out lines with whatever they could get their hands on, from stray bits of rope to wiring from old garden machinery. These matches would run on indefinitely. \u201cHe would not understand or accept that he was losing,\u201d Mischa says. If Sascha lost they would have to play again. Mischa would often throw the match on purpose just so he could go to bed.\n\nThe two children were very different. Mischa was quiet and Sascha was boisterous. Whereas Mischa occupied the tennis court with a Stakhanovite sense of purpose, Sascha played hockey and football with the same frenetic energy, and trained less rigorously than his brother. \u201cTennis for him was like toys,\u201d his mother says. His natural gifts carried him far against local competition. But global opponents were harder. When he was about 12, his parents took him to Florida to play in a prestigious junior tournament and he lost in the second round to a younger player. \u201cAfterwards he cried\u201d, his mother says, \u201cand said, \u2018I\u2019m the best! Why did I lose?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Sascha, you lost because you don\u2019t do any fitness, because you don\u2019t practise enough.\u2019\u201d He gave up hockey, he gave up football. From now on it was just tennis.\n\nIn his younger years, when his father was often away with Mischa, he played with his mother. Sessions with her had a relaxed atmosphere. Now he began to train with his father, who would sometimes patrol the backcourt with a stop-watch in his hand, timing sets of cross-court forehands or down-the-line backhands. \u201cHe had a very Soviet way of doing physical training sessions,\u201d Zverev says. \u201cWe would go to the track and we would run 15 laps, and we had to run them in under 30 minutes. Then we would do sprint drills and 400-metre runs, and then sometimes at the end of the sessions we would have to re-do the 15 laps, again in under 30 minutes. I didn\u2019t like them. But I\u2019d seen my brother doing it, so I thought this was normal, I thought this was something that everybody was doing.\u201d\n\nOn the court, his father instilled in him a philosophy of \u201cfast tennis\u201d \u2013 sprinting, hitting the ball hard and taking risks in order to win points as quickly as possible. But unlike Mischa, who even as a kid was strong and stocky and hardly ever missed, Sascha was weak and gangly and missed all the time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t obvious that he was going to be better than Mischa,\u201d says Lars Kirschner, who played on the club team in Hamburg when the boys were growing up. \u201cHe made a lot of errors. We sometimes wondered whether this was the right strategy.\u201d His nemesis as a junior was an American called Stefan Koslov. \u201cA lot of kids win by not missing, by running and just putting the ball in and making the other kids go nuts with it,\u201d Zverev says. Koslov was that kind of player and he beat Sascha repeatedly.\n\nBut to his parents, winning wasn\u2019t important. What mattered was learning to play like a pro. Each time he lost, his father consoled him. \u201cI said, it\u2019s OK , this is not a big problem. We must stay this way, we must practice fast tennis, aggressive tennis. If you lose today it\u2019s no big deal. You must think about the future.\u201d\n\nOne muggy night in 2012, after Zverev had lost in the second round of the Orange Bowl, a junior tournament in Plantation, Florida, his father and brother had dinner in Miami with Patricio Apey, a sports agent with form in finding young players with talent: he had once signed a teenage Andy Murray. Over terrible food at an all-American steakhouse, Apey offered to represent Sascha. \u201cI met him in the car park afterwards,\u201d said Apey, a diminutive man, \u201cand I looked up and I went, \u2018Holy shit! If tennis doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019re going to Abercrombie and Fitch.\u2019 Here was this beach-bum kid who was just beautiful!\u201d\n\nThe following July at Wimbledon, Apey asked Jez Green, Murray\u2019s physical trainer, to watch Zverev in the junior tournament. Green didn\u2019t watch for long, but he liked what he saw. \u201cHe was so tall and gangly, any kind of power meant he was all over the place. But when he got in the right position, with a bit of imagination, you realised that these shots could be something very special.\u201d Green asked Murray, who would go on to win Wimbledon that year, if he could moonlight for Zverev, and Murray agreed. \u201cSascha was a 16-year-old kid,\u201d Green says. \u201cHe was no threat.\u201d\n\nThey began working together the following winter at Saddlebrook. At first Green just watched Zverev train. \u201cI realised that to go to the next few levels, they were going to have to change quite a bit,\u201d he says. He sat Zverev and his parents down and explained what needed to be done. \u201cI said, look, what do you want to have a go at? If you\u2019ve really got aspirations for the top five and beyond, then you\u2019re going to need a physique that never breaks down.\u201d That would mean completely remodelling Sascha\u2019s body. The process, he told them, would take five years.\n\nOne of the most noticeable recent trends in men\u2019s tennis has been the players\u2019 increased longevity. Between 1995 and 2018, the average age of a pro in the top 100 increased from 24 to almost 29, as fewer and fewer youngsters broke into the top levels of the game. The days when a teenager could arrive on tour and win a grand slam, as Boris Becker did as a 17-year-old at Wimbledon in 1985, are long gone. \u201cPhysicality has a lot to do with it,\u201d says Todd Ellenbecker, the tour\u2019s chief physio. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have 16- or 17-year-old males able to compete with mature adults on tour.\u201d\n\nThe physical challenges of tennis have changed in recent years. This is largely thanks to developments in string technology. In the late 1990s, players started to use \u201cpoly strings\u201d made out of tough industrial polymers previously deployed in the aerospace industry. Poly strings have several advantages over the natural gut strings and their synthetic variants which players had been using for decades. The most significant is that they impart outrageous amounts of top-spin to a tennis ball. While gut strings shift in the string bed when struck by the ball, and then stay in their new position, poly strings move and then snap back, giving the ball extra whip. Andre Agassi used to hit forehands at 1,800rpm. Today Rafael Nadal can manage as much as 5,000rpm.\n\nTop-spin makes the ball dip sharply into the court, giving players extra control, and because they had to worry less about hitting the ball out, they could focus more on hitting it hard. \u201cFifteen or 20 years ago you needed to be more precise,\u201d says Mark Kovacs, an expert in the biomechanics of tennis. \u201cNow you can be aggressive from nearly anywhere on the court. You can really throw your whole body into it.\u201d This in turn made it easier to play from the back of the court: serves could be returned with greater power and sharply angled passing shots could be hit with a greater chance of success. The serve-and-volley style, in which a big server rushes the net to put away a predictably weak return, died out, leaving the sport dominated by players who can outmanoeuvre their opponents from the baseline in battles of booming groundstrokes and lightning foot speed.\n\nAll of this created a new kind of physiological challenge. The fitness regimes of players of an earlier generation consisted of lifting weights, running and cycling for miles on end. Players still do all of that, but they have added dedicated forms of training aimed at withstanding the rigours of the new style. Paradoxically, these are not so much focused on making the body move faster, but on teaching it how to slow down. \u201cTennis is really about deceleration at the highest level,\u201d Jez Green says.\n\nSlowing down has two elements. One is about training the muscles used to decelerate the racket after the ball has been struck. Owing to the force with which players now swing, this has become more difficult. A common injury in the modern game is to the rotator cuff, the group of muscles at the back of the shoulder that extend during serves and forehands and then have to contract to prevent the shoulder being ripped out of its socket by the force of the swing. These muscles break down from stress and overuse, and in the modern game\u2019s long baseline battles they are used more than ever.\n\nPlayers also need to train the muscles used to stop the whole body when it changes direction on the run \u2013 which, because tennis is now more kinetic, it has to do more often. Green once analysed a match between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, and found that during a single point they changed direction 40 times. \u201cTrain that!\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not stopping easily. They\u2019re stopping with huge force. At some point they\u2019re decelerating 12 times their body weight. Twelve times! And they have to stabilise that and then reaccelerate somewhere else. That force is really ridiculous.\u201d If players don\u2019t learn to stop efficiently, they will not only be slower around the court but, thanks to the forces shooting through their extremities, injuries to their knees and ankles will force them into early retirement. This risk is especially pronounced among tall players like Zverev, because heavier bodies exert more momentum on the run and long limbs are more prone to instability.\n\nThe process of reconstructing Zverev\u2019s body required sacrifices. Green requested long training blocks, which meant Zverev had to abandon the tour before the end of the season, missing out on ranking points and prize money. He also demanded that during those two-month periods Zverev play no tennis, otherwise bad habits would come back and render the whole exercise useless. One day, during the first year, Zverev\u2019s racket sponsor, Head, delivered some new equipment for him to try out, and he and his father couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cJez lost it,\u201d Apey says. \u201cHe went up to the father and said, \u2018When it\u2019s time for fitness, you listen to me. When it\u2019s time for tennis, I listen to you!\u2019 Then he chucked everyone off the court.\u201d\n\nFor almost a year, Green focused on nothing but stability. \u201cThe first task with a body like that is to protect it,\u201d he says. He went through every joint in Zverev\u2019s body, making sure it was aligned and then strengthening the muscles controlling its function. This work consisted of a series of minute, slow movements that looked like tai chi. Zverev, who was used to his father\u2019s more strenuous methods, thought it was absurd. \u201cThe first sessions were weird,\u201d he says. Zverev lay on the floor and Green got him to do tiny exercises, like moving his leg up and down repeatedly. \u201cI was, like, this is pointless! I don\u2019t think Murray won Wimbledon like this!\u201d Zverev says.\n\nOnce Green was happy that each joint was set, he began to direct force through them. He wasn\u2019t interested in strength for its own sake, he was interested in it only in so far as it served a purpose on a tennis court. At the heart of this was a kind of choreographic training to ingrain what Green calls \u201cthe tennis dance\u201d in Zverev\u2019s muscles. They would spend hours running through the step sequences that he would employ in every match: the three lunging steps that would take him to a wide forehand, or the five that would allow him to hit a passing shot on the run before pivoting on his inside foot and planting his outside foot to decelerate and shift direction. As well as lifting weights, Zverev would strengthen these postures with squats, which look like the split step every sequence begins with, and lunges, which mirror the deceleration step taken on the run, often attached to long elastic bands whose resistance built muscle control.\n\nAt the end of each cycle, Zverev had put on several kilos of muscle \u2013 Green aimed for 4kg a year. He then realised that he no longer knew how to play. \u201cI had no idea what was going on in my body,\u201d he says. Suddenly shots that he had refined through years of repetition felt weird and needed adaptation.\n\nGradually he found a new rhythm and the benefits began to show. \u201cHe started to become less wobbly,\u201d Green says. \u201cHe started to absorb power, so when someone hit hard he could hit the ball back and everything locked into place.\u201d Players back at the club in Hamburg who\u2019d once been able to hold their own against Zverev suddenly found they couldn\u2019t touch him.\n\nIn June 2014, in the first round of a tournament in Braunschweig, Zverev beat his compatriot Tobias Kamke in straight sets \u2013 the first time he had ever defeated a player in the top 100. A week later, playing in his first ever ATP Tour tournament, he reached the semi-finals in Hamburg. Along the way, he beat Mikhail Youzney, a top-20 player. \u201cI had no idea I could do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in a dream, I didn\u2019t know what was happening.\u201d\n\nAs he got stronger and faster, he continued to move up the rankings. In 2015 he went from 136 in the world to 83, becoming the youngest player in the top 100. In 2016 he climbed higher still and began facing the toughest opposition. At Indian Wells, a Masters tournament in California, he came within match point of defeating Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. Nadal saved the point and went on to win the match. Zverev left the court in tears.\n\nHe made up for it in June that year. In the semi-finals of the pre-Wimbledon grass-court tournament in Halle, Germany, he beat Roger Federer in three sets. He was the first teenager to beat Federer since Andy Murray did so in 2006.\n\nOne afternoon in January, during the Australian Open, Federer was at his hotel in Melbourne watching the tennis on TV . On the screen was the third-round match between Zverev and Hyeon Chung, a 21-year-old South Korean. The match had see-sawed and after more than three hours it had entered a fifth set, at which point Zverev began to implode: he lost his opening service game to love, and before long was down 0-3. He threw his racket to the ground, clamped it with his foot, and snapped it in half. Fifteen minutes later he lost 0-6. He had won only five points in the entire set.\n\nDespite Zverev\u2019s speedy rise, doubts lingered about his game. He had never made the quarter-final, or even beaten a top-50 player, at a grand slam. Matches in most professional tournaments are best of three sets, but the four Grand Slams are best of five. Longer matches sap players\u2019 energy and offer more opportunities for dramatic reversal, and in these Zverev had a habit of collapsing disastrously. The loss to Chung, a player ranked more than 50 places below him, was the most egregious example yet. Perhaps it was physical exhaustion, perhaps it was the pressure of expectation, perhaps both.\n\nAfter the match Federer saw Zverev sitting on a bench in the locker room. \u201cI thought that I would maybe share a little anecdote from my career,\u201d Federer says. He reminded Zverev that even though he\u2019d won more Grand Slams than any player in history, it had taken a long time for him to break through. \u201cI was also known for maybe being the talent that was never going to fully utilise my potential,\u201d Federer says. He suggested Zverev set himself more reachable goals in the biggest tournaments, aim for a quarter-final first, and not dig himself into a hole. Zverev was only 20, after all; Federer hadn\u2019t reached his first quarter-final until the age of 22. \u201cI thought it would maybe be a mood-changer,\u201d Federer says, \u201cbecause he was sitting there depressed and I just felt sorry for him.\u201d\n\nFive months later, Zverev arrived in Paris to play in the French Open, the second grand slam of the season. He was feeling defiant. After Monte Carlo, where he\u2019d reached the semi-finals, he\u2019d won the tournaments in Munich and Madrid. Such was his dominance in Spain that he\u2019d become the first player in history to win the event without facing a single break point all week. He had won 14 matches on the bounce, and had amassed more ranking points than any other player in 2018. \u201cEverybody was saying what a horrible start to the year it was,\u201d he reflected coolly. \u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t that horrible.\u201d\n\nThe French Open proved a partial answer to his critics. Having breezed through the first round, he got into trouble against his next three opponents, and each match went to five sets. But he found a way to win them all, beating two top-50 players along the way and leaping the hurdle that Federer had put in his path in January, making his first grand-slam quarter-final. The results suggested that he was learning how to cope with the emotional and physical exertions of long matches. But then, a month later in the third round at Wimbledon, he fell apart in the fifth set against a qualifier ranked 138, citing illness and exhaustion. A worrying pattern of vulnerability seemed to be emerging.\n\nRight now, this inconsistency stands between him and the summit of the sport. The two players ahead of him are looking back with interest. \u201cHe needs to be a bit patient, he needs success at the grand-slam level where most points lie, he needs to stay injury free,\u201d Federer says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re as tall as him that\u2019s always going to be a challenge...But it looks like Sascha is working in the right way.\u201d Asked recently about Zverev\u2019s future, Nadal said that it\u2019s impossible to be that good and not succeed at grand slams. If his prediction didn\u2019t come true, \u201cyou can come back to me and tell me, \u2018You don\u2019t know anything about tennis.\u2019\u201d", "sentiment": 0.11236442953020138, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Can Alexander Zverev become the world\u2019s best tennis player?"}, {"published": "2018-09-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://execed.economist.com/emlyon-business-school/general-management-program-2018-09-01", "text": "Given name\n\nFamily name\n\nYour email address\n\nYour phone number\n\nJob Title Please select a job title Top-level (C-Suite, Owner, President, Director) Mid-level (Vice President, regional manager, managing director) Professional (associate, analyst, lower level manager) Entry level, intern or student\n\nIndustry Please select an industry Accounting and finance Corporate planning/business development Education/teaching Engineering General management Human resources International operations IT/computers/technology Legal/lawyer Manufacturing/production Medical PR/corporate communications Property and premises Public policy Scientific and technical services Sales Transport and distribution Other\n\nSubmit\n\nDisclaimer: When you click submit, we will send an email on your behalf to EMLYON Business School from which you are requesting information.

But we aren\u2019t on the list of expected guests. We show our ID s and ask him to call his superiors, but he won\u2019t budge. We protest for nearly half an hour and I can feel his temper rising.\n\nSuddenly his rifle drops from his shoulder. He takes a short run up then kicks the ground in front of us. A fellow soldier joins in. Muhammad winces. I start to think it\u2019s game over.\n\nThen they both turn to us, laughing, and point at Muhammad\u2019s notebook, which has a huge picture of Cristiano Ronaldo on the front cover. Luckily for us, the Real Madrid star had scored a match-saving penalty in the Champions League the night before. Conakry, the capital of Guinea, is normally a jangling metropolis but it had been uncannily quiet for the game. But when Ronaldo scored in the final minute, a roar echoed through the dark streets from every packed bar and restaurant, like a Friday call to prayer.\n\nAfter trying our own re-enactments, we chat about the game and I stretch my feeble football knowledge to the limit, analysing the mixed fortunes of the English Premier League. It works. The tension dissipates and they eventually decide we aren\u2019t a threat. They wave us through to the next checkpoint. I grin at Muhammad who\u2019s sheepishly hiding his schoolboy-style fan-art. In west Africa well-timed football banter can get you a long way.\n\nThe region has produced some of the best players in the world and many people are extraordinarily passionate about the game. After the patriotic fervour and jubilation at the final whistle when Senegal beat its former colonial master France in the 2002 World Cup, the President declared the next day a national holiday. Players who make it internationally are revered back home as heroes and can have a huge amount of influence. This year Guinea\u2019s neighbour, Liberia, elected one of the greatest footballers of all time, George Weah, as President. In 2006 in neighbouring Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Chelsea striker and national captain, Didier Drogba played a crucial role in getting soldiers to lay down their arms after five years of civil war.\n\nFootball gives many boys and young men with no options in life hope that they can be something else and achieve international glory, says Mathieu Chupin, who runs Dakar Sacr\u00e9 Coeur, one of Senegal\u2019s footie training camps, and helps many people to feel part of something bigger than themselves. Such love can work to a traveller\u2019s advantage. A bit of football chat works wonders building warmth with many people you have otherwise little connection with; it can even put you on the same side of a bitter rivalry.\n\nTravelling in west Africa poses challenges I haven\u2019t found elsewhere. On the road from Guinea\u2019s capital to Freetown in Sierra Leone there are about a dozen checkpoints where armed men take it in turns to extract as much money as possible from passers-by. On a recent trip, one accused me of having the wrong papers, another that the window tinting of my car was illegal, yet another said my bag looked suspicious. I was robbed five times before I began to develop a rudimentary evasion strategy.\n\nSo I\u2019ve started using football to help me out of a corner. When asked where I\u2019m from, I now get the conversation onto football by any means I can. Then I act exuberantly surprised when I find out their team and pretend to be a fellow diehard fan. For good measure I throw in a few insults of the main rival. Where possible, I do this before anyone has had a chance to \u201cfine\u201d me.", "sentiment": 0.12236578947368418, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Football is a lingua franca in west Africa"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T10:43:17+01:00", "link": "https://www.1843magazine.com/features/saddam-hussein-my-part-in-his-downfall", "text": "When they dimmed the lights on the plane to Kuwait, the soldiers nodded off to sleep or talked quietly. I continued to stare at them, just glad to be in their company. Old-timers, who were hanging on to get their pension, were grumbling. Those with families looked nervous. But the younger soldiers like me, who were off to battle for the first time, were buzzing. This was going to be the greatest adventure of my life. Our training had made war seem so wholesome. We\u2019d run across endless fields in Essex, laughing as we dived for cover on the cry of \u201cdown\u201d and came up with mouths full of grass. We\u2019d sit up all night in the foxholes we\u2019d dug in the cold, hard Salisbury soil, making cups of tea because that\u2019s what the British do to fill time. None of my buddies expected to die. I felt bullet proof.\n\nWe landed in Kuwait and were bussed to enormous hangars next to the airport, where we waited for our vehicles to arrive. Compared with the Americans, we were under-equipped and ill-prepared. Our camouflage was designed for the verdant English countryside. There wasn\u2019t enough body armour to go round. When our Land Rovers showed up, they were still green. Someone found a carwash, filled it up with sand-coloured paint and hosed them up and down. At the same time, we were worried about the Americans\u2019 propensity for friendly fire. To warn trigger-happy pilots, soldiers pinned enormous Union Jacks on their roofs and bonnets, which made me wonder why they\u2019d bothered to camouflage their rides in the first place.\n\nI was attached to the US Marines. Our task was to defuse mines, allowing the Americans to race up the road to Baghdad. It was clear they were ready. Every soldier had desert uniforms and night-vision scopes (we had to share ours around). They boasted that 900 shells had been allocated for each target and that a hill surmounted with an Iraqi observation post could expect to have 20 metres blasted off the top. Talk like this made them seem slightly unhinged but it also gave us confidence that the war would be a cinch.\n\nThen there was the food. American rations were about three times the size of ours. They had peanut butter, ice-cream on tap and so much cereal that it seemed as if Kellogg\u2019s was the primary sponsor of the US Army. All we had to offer was old-school memorabilia such as cap badges and stable belts, which we would trade for things we really ought to have been equipped with, like tents.\n\nOver the course of five or six weeks, we inched towards the Iraqi border. As we got closer, the bombs began to fall. We presumed that Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons, so we spent all day and all night in boots and thick charcoal-lined camouflage suits that would neutralise nerve agents. We got so used to these frequent attacks that at night, when the sirens woke us, we\u2019d groggily pull on our gas masks and fall asleep again.\n\nThe more time I spent with the American soldiers, the more they appeared both ludicrous and inspirational. I met an overweight marine whose only job was filling up Humvees with diesel. He carried out his duties wearing four serious-looking knives strapped across his chest. I once asked him why he needed these. \u201cI\u2019m done with the hors d\u2019oeuvres,\u201d he said. \u201cBring me the main course.\u201d The Yanks came into their own at roll call. On one occasion, a sergeant failed to get a response after calling out a couple of names. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhere the fuck are they? If I was handing out blow jobs and pay cheques they\u2019d be here.\u201d We turned up at 7am each morning, just to hear what his banter would be like.\n\nBut the Americans also seemed committed and purposeful. They genuinely believed in service. Just before we invaded, we lined up with hundreds of American troops while a general walked up and down the ranks, asking each soldier his name, asking who was waiting for him back home and exhorting him to fuck these people up so we could all get out.\n\nOn the night of March 21st 2003, we crossed the border at Umm Qasr. We drove through the night without our lights on. Our mouths were filled with the taste of exhilaration and burning oil. The Iraqis had dug trenches, filled them with petrol and set them alight, in the hope that the white devils would plunge into them and be consumed by flames. This feature made them easy to spot and circumnavigate. Next to me sat a soldier we called Taff. He was anxious \u2013 he had left behind a wife and young son \u2013 and this manifested itself in his annoyance that I was so untroubled. As we drove deeper into Iraq, he asked me to shoot him if Iraqi soldiers rushed the vehicle. I refused and suggested that we would be better turning our weapons on the enemy. \u201cShoot me,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWhat would happen then?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019d have to shoot myself. Which is hard with a fucking rifle.\u201d We argued back and forth until we realised the absurdity of the debate and fell about laughing.\n\nOur first encounter with Iraqis came shortly after. A water bowser was trundling across our position from left to right. Instinctively, we suspected a suicide-bomber. Four of us leapt up and ran towards it: better that we were killed than our whole unit. We stopped as we drew close to them. I took off my helmet and body armour, handed my rifle to a US Marine. \u201cIf they come for me, shoot them,\u201d I said and walked towards the people driving the bowser.\n\nI had started learning Arabic in Kuwait. I could say \u201casalaam aleikum\u201d and make basic small talk: \u201cIs this a minefield?\u201d; \u201cHave you seen any insurgents?\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you.\u201d You can achieve an enormous amount, I discovered, by reading expressions and drawing shapes in the sand and enthusiastically waving your hands. In this instance I worked out enough to see that the family didn\u2019t want to kill us. They had lost their house in the bombing and we managed to find them shelter. (At other times, my basic Arabic was less clear: at one point a man thought that I was encouraging him to let his dog run across a minefield; fortunately, the dog avoided being blown up.)\n\nThe Americans ripped through the country, wired on rock music and pills. We moved more slowly, taking care to defuse or destroy the mines and booby-traps that were laid for us. On March 23rd we heard that one of the bomb-disposal teams had been ambushed. Two soldiers escaped and told how rocket-propelled grenades had easily punched through the soft skins of their Land Rovers. But two other soldiers were missing. One was Simon, a veteran, who I remembered holding a rifle in the air and telling us to keep ours clean, because \u201cthese are our passports home\u201d. The other was my mate Luke.\n\nSoldiers from the Black Watch regiment went out straight away, kicking down doors and shaking people up. The next day out on patrol, time seemed to slow down agonisingly. People grew fidgety. Lots of us had never been shot at before, let alone had a friend who was missing in action. Some began to check in on their comrades. \u201cIf they come for us, are you going to shoot at them?\u201d one soldier asked me. When we got back to base, the disappearances were all we talked about. We were even more worried when we heard the Black Watch hadn\u2019t turned up anything. By the second day, we were just waiting to hear that they were dead. I\u2019d been told back in Burnley that only Muslims went to heaven but I hoped Luke would be able to charm his way in.\n\nWhen my commanding officer told me to rally the troops, I knew it only meant one thing. The bodies of Luke and Simon had been discovered and it was clear that they\u2019d been tortured. The last time I\u2019d seen Luke was in Kuwait, as we stood side by side painting Land Rovers yellow. War had seemed like it would be fun and games. Adventure. Heroics. Now we realised it was real. And how vulnerable we were.\n\nLuke and Simon were sent off on a warm night at an airfield in Kuwait. We went on parade. The padre \u2013 our unit\u2019s priest \u2013 led a service. \u201cThe Last Post\u201d was played and then the two bodies were carried on the shoulders of their friends up the ramp of the awaiting Hercules. I didn\u2019t read many books at the time, but on the photo of Luke I kept in my diary, I wrote out a quotation from T.E. Lawrence: \u201cWe pay for these things too much in honour and in innocent lives.\u201d\n\nAfter the service, some Brits started chatting up a group of newly arrived female soldiers from America. A couple managed to impress them with their war stories and took them off to a jeep that was soon bouncing up and down merrily on its suspension. It was what Luke would have wanted. But this love nest, it transpired, had been made in the padre\u2019s Land Rover.

Like many old friends, we argue a lot, about matters both important and trivial. But the thing we argue about the most, the thing we have argued about for years, the thing that forms a cleavage as vast as the Grand Canyon, is how to organise the files on our computers.\n\nHer method is legible and easily understood by anybody. Her folders are neatly organised by media type and year. Subfolders are listed alphabetically. It is all perfectly logical in a way that Spock would approve of. My folders, on the other hand, are arranged in a bottom-up fashion, with names that make sense to me, subfolders that belong where I, but only I, would think to look for them, sub-sub-folders nested within them, a numbering system that prioritises the ones I need most often close to the top of the list, and so on. It is organic and, to most outsiders, a complete shambles. But it works for me.\n\nSo it is with organising my life. I have tried paper diaries, Google Calendar and to-do apps. No matter the form, what they all have in common is a rigid structure imposed from above. You have a certain number of lines for each day or a finite number of categories into which your plans must fit, or a small palette of colours to highlight or distinguish between events. It drives me insane. So I made my own system: a Google spreadsheet with columns titled \u201ctoday\u201d, \u201ctomorrow\u201d, \u201cthis week\u201d, \u201cweekend\u201d, \u201cthis month\u201d and \u201cthree months\u201d, and tabs to keep track of expenses, books I\u2019ve read, travel plans, story ideas, and general note-keeping. It\u2019s messy and entirely manual: there are no shortcuts, no functions, no add-ons.\n\nWhich brings me to the Bullet Journal. When my colleagues at 1843 suggested I try this so-called \u201canalogue system for the digital age\u201d, I was sceptical. This \u201csystem\u201d was developed by a designer in Brooklyn called Ryder Carroll, and has sparked a thriving sub-culture of \u201cbullet journalists\u201d. There are blogs dedicated to the art. The Instagram hashtag #bulletjournal has 2.2m pictures, many of beautiful, arty journals. The hashtag #bujo has another 1.7m. It appeared to be some sort of cult of productivity.\n\nTicked off Sample pages from a Bullet Journal (Image: bulletjournal.com)\n\nStill, the simplicity of the idea was appealing. Here is how it works: you take a blank notebook, any blank notebook. You can, if you wish, buy a special one, but the notebook isn\u2019t the point \u2013 the Bullet Journal is a method, not an object. You number the pages as you go along, having set aside a few pages at the front that over time become your contents list. Then each month you handwrite a calendar called the \u201cmonthly log\u201d followed by a \u201cdaily log\u201d of tasks, events and notes, marked respectively by bullet points, circles and dashes. Each day you manually cross out tasks you have completed and then rewrite the undone ones for the next day.\n\nThis system has two attractions. The first is flexibility. The pages are blank, yours to make of what you will. Most diaries and apps operate under the assumption that each day is equal, and allocate them the same amount of space. But in reality, some days are busy while others are spent binge-watching Netflix, which means that some pages become crammed full of notes while others sit there empty.\n\nThe Bullet Journal\u2019s blank canvas erases these false restrictions. My entry for July 13th is only three lines long (come on, it was a Friday), but on the 14th there were 11 items on the agenda. As I went through the week, I added random observations up the side. Not all make sense on re-reading \u2013 why did I annotate my to-do list for July 11th with \u201cdaddy pig: why not papa pig?\u201d \u2013 but recording your thoughts as you make plans and list ideas gives the Bullet Journal a nice sense of temporality and intimacy. The slots in my Google spreadsheet, say, don\u2019t tell me when I wrote something, or what else I was thinking about as I wrote it. It is clinical by comparison.\n\nThe second attraction is inconvenience. Rewriting those undone items is a bloody hassle, so each day, for each task, you ask yourself: is this really something I need to do? Does it have to be on the list? If I\u2019ve been writing and rewriting something and haven\u2019t done it for two weeks, should I just either do it or ditch it? Using Bullet Journal made me more aware of what I was postponing or deluding myself about. I\u2019ve finally concluded I\u2019m probably never going to get around to deleting idiotic pictures from my photo library stretching back three years. It wasn\u2019t the thought of actually doing the task that eventually put me off. It was rewriting it on a new page. Nor am I ever going to go through my files to chuck out old paperwork. For years I dutifully copy-pasted these items around my spreadsheet, or just let them linger in that \u201cthree month\u201d tab. No more! I am free of these mundane tasks forever.", "sentiment": 0.0618490566037736, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "How the Bullet Journal stopped me lying to myself"}, {"published": "2018-07-18T16:27:18+01:00", "link": "https://www.1843magazine.com/data-graphic/what-the-numbers-say/the-worlds-top-beaches-a-statisticians-guide", "text": "It is easy to be overwhelmed by choice when booking a beach holiday. Our planet has 350,000km of coastline, much of it perfect for laying a towel on. TripAdvisor, a travel website, has published a selection of the 25 most highly rated shores, from Australia to Zanzibar. Unfortunately, it gives no clues as to which ones will give you the best tan for the best price.\n\nI learned this first hand. I once booked a trip to the sparkling sand and azure waters of Grace Bay in Turks and Caicos, TripAdvisor\u2019s top pick, only to spend nearly half of it under a dripping umbrella. Rain loungers aren\u2019t much fun. So the first step in this data-driven guide to beach holidays is a simple one: check the weather.\n\nSince exotic breaks aren\u2019t cheap, you may want a destination where at least three-quarters of days are rain-free. That rules out Turks and Caicos, according to Weather-Atlas.com, and plenty of others on TripAdvisor\u2019s list: the top spots in the Seychelles, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, as well as Brazil\u2019s Baia do Sancho, Australia\u2019s Manly Beach, and Britain\u2019s quaint seaside resort of Bournemouth. The best beaches in Tanzania and Jamaica would pass only for a couple of months each year.\n\nNext on the checklist are accommodation and access. Readers will love the crystal waters of Egypt\u2019s Sharm El Luli and Greece\u2019s Elafonissi Lagoon, but not the lack of decent places to stay within five miles. Listings from Expedia, a bookings website, show a dearth of four-star hotels near the best beaches in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Cape Verde, Goa in India or Lampedusa in Italy \u2013 you may be better off renting via Airbnb.\n\nGoogle Flights, an airline aggregator, suggests that to get to those destinations can be a slog, but not as hard as White Beach in the Philippines, which usually takes at least 24 hours from either London or New York.\n\nOf the other options, the Cayman Islands and Florida\u2019s Clearwater Beach are pricey: hotel rooms cost at least $270 (\u00a3205) a night in high season. They are half that rate in Mexico\u2019s Playa Norte, and even less at the postcard-perfect Varadero Beach in Cuba or Eagle Beach in Aruba. The latter is largely rain-free for eight months a year.\n\nFlights from America to the Caribbean cost about $400; Europeans pay about twice as much. But on their doorstep are cheap and cheerful options, including Spain\u2019s La Concha, Portugal\u2019s Falesia and Cyprus\u2019s Fig Tree Bay.\n\nThe winner must surely be Turkey\u2019s Kleopatra Beach: less than \u00a3200 to fly from most European capitals, and not much more for a week in a hotel. With an average of just three days of rain between June and August, you may even get to enjoy your sun lounger.\n\nTop five beaches for average user rating (On TripAdvisor)\n\nTop five beaches for lack of rain\n\nTop five beaches for cheap hotels (4* rated, on Expedia.com)\n\nTop five beaches for cheap London flights (return in economy)", "sentiment": 0.3772521739130435, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "The world\u2019s top beaches: a statistician\u2019s guide"}, {"published": "2018-06-20T12:06:32-04:00", "link": "https://execed.economist.com/blog/career-hacks/how-work-less-and-achieve-more", "text": "In the U.S., the 40-hour work week actually averages 47 hours, according to a Gallup poll. Specifically, salaried employees average 49 hours of work per week, and 50% of them work anywhere from 50 to over 60 hours weekly. Even when workers are off, they tend to be tethered to their digital devices, responding to work-related phone calls and also text and email messages.\n\nEmployees at every level report stress and increased work demands, and a variety of issues are causing executives to be sleepless in the C-suite.\n\nWorking harder, however, is not the answer, according to Morten Hansen, management professor at the University of California Berkeley and co-author (with Jim Collins) of \u201cGreat by Choice.\u201d\n\nHansen conducted a five-year study of more than 5,000 managers and workers, and discovered the reason some people perform better at work than others. His findings form the basis for his new book, \u201cGreat at Work: How Top Performers Work Less and Achieve More,\u201d which is one of 11 leadership books recommended by The Washington Post for 2018.\n\nWe asked Hansen to share a few findings from his book.\n\nWorking harder isn\u2019t the key to improving performance\n\nIn the classroom and the workplace, there\u2019s a tendency to think that an increase in effort leads to an improvement in performance, but this is not necessarily the case.\n\n\u201cThe working hard model is like squeezing an orange,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cAs you improve the number of hours and you go from 30 to 40 hours, it will increase performance, but then you keep squeezing to get to 60 hours.\u201d\n\nAt this point, your efforts are counterproductive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s less juice, and you\u2019re getting less quality and you\u2019re actually detracting from your work,\u201d he explains. \u201cAt some point, there\u2019s only pulp coming out and you\u2019re getting diminishing returns.\u201d\n\nHansen\u2019s study of 5,000 people in corporate America found that going from working 30 hours up to 50 hours does indeed result in an improvement in performance, but, he explains, \u201cfrom 50 hours to 65 hours, the curve is flattening quite a bit, and at 65 hours, it starts going down.\u201d\n\nSo, while working harder seems to be the ethos of our workplace culture, Hansen warns, \u201cthe evidence does not support this and top performers don\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nThe disadvantages of working harder\n\nAn increase in workplace effort deceives both employees and leaders into thinking that they are working hard because they are working more hours. But, they\u2019re actually doing something else.\n\n\u201cYou start ruining your life because your work is really encroaching on your private time,\u201d Hansen explains.\n\nIf you work 50 hours per week, he says you\u2019re dedicating 10 hours per day to your job\u2014and even if you\u2019re just checking emails or making phone calls from the convenience of your home, he says you\u2019re still working.\n\n\u201cThis is a severe tradeoff\u2014you\u2019re willing to sacrifice a part of life thinking it is going to make you more successful and the evidence is that it is not,\u201d Hansen explains.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve been guilty as well: when I graduated from college, I was working 60 or 70 hours a week.\u201d But then, he says that he met colleagues who were performing at a higher level even though they were working fewer hours.\n\nHow leaders and employees can work smarter\n\n\u201cWork smart, not hard\u201d has become a common workplace phrase, but Hansen doesn\u2019t think most people really know what that means.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a clich\u00e9, and obviously, no one wants to work dumb.\u201d But, if people don\u2019t understand how to work smart, not hard, there\u2019s no way they can make the necessary adjustments.\n\nHis first recommendation is to be selective about what you do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having the ability and willingness and courage to really focus on the very few things that matter the most.\u201d\n\nWhile you may have a long list of things to do, Hansen says there are really only a few things that you must do\u2014and you need to do those few things well.\n\n\u201cDecide what to focus on in every area: your meetings, your collaborations, your tasks, your projects.\u201d\n\nHansen shares his definition of smart work.\n\n\u201cYou select a few key activities that maximise what you do, then apply intense, targeted effort, and then you have to say \u2018no\u2019 to the rest of the activities.\u201d He believes that working smart requires focusing on\u2014actually, obsessing over\u2014these few key activities.\n\nHow bosses can help their employees work smarter\n\nLeaders have a greater degree of freedom in choosing how to spend their time. Employees, however, are not afforded as much leeway since they\u2019re subject to the dictates of their bosses.\n\n\u201cThere are \u2018do more\u2019 bosses and \u2018do less\u2019 bosses: the problem with \u2018do more\u2019 bosses is that they give employees a lot of things to do,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cThey\u2019re piling on the work, so they need to stop and ask themselves how they can trim those priority lists.\u201d\n\nOften, bosses are also overwhelmed with work; however, Hansen says that a good boss doesn\u2019t pass the pressure and unrealistic workload on to their employees.\n\n\u201cAnd it is bosses that most of the surveyed people blame for having too much to do,\u201d he says.\n\nCommunicating simply, thoroughly and clearly can also help employees to understand and focus on what\u2019s important. Hansen advises against convoluted emails and an overabundance of PowerPoint slides.\n\n\u201cEven if you give really good directions, but your language is muddled, people don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you say \u2018we\u2019re trying to be the best retail store in the city,\u2019 what does \u2018best\u2019 mean? Is that selling the most bikes\u2014which means that selling is the priority? Or is it delivering the best customer service?\u201d\n\nIn addition, he believes that bosses need to do a better job of inspiring their employees. Yes, workers get a paycheck, but Hansen says that\u2019s not the only reason they come to work. Companies should be concerned if employees are not inspired or engaged, since drudgery is unlikely to motivate them to work smarter.\n\n\u201cThey want to feel what they do is important and they want to be uplifted,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cMy data says inspired employees perform better.\u201d\n\nBrowse leadership courses for executives\n\n--\n\nTerri Williams is a freelance writer who covers leadership topics for The Economist Careers Network.", "sentiment": 0.19295000000000004, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "How to work less and achieve more"}, {"published": "2018-09-06T00:00:00", "link": "https://execed.economist.com/irish-management-institute/taking-lead-women-leadership-2018-09-06?gsrc=wmbaslider", "text": "In February 2017, IMI and the 30% Club conducted a focus group with over 50 women in senior leadership roles in Ireland.

Some web browsers may transmit \u201cdo-not-track\u201d signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.

Was it my last day at school? Sometime in the 1980s? I\u2019m not too sure, but one thing I do know for certain is that this season is witnessing the return of the hair accessory. And these useful updaters are back as beautiful pieces to adorn and enhance any hair style. Think of them as part of your jewellery collection, as an alternative or an addition to earrings. \u201cHair accessories are certainly an emerging trend and, I predict, one we will continue to see more of,\u201d says Lisa Aiken, retail fashion director at Net-a-Porter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trend was kicked off when a plethora of hair accessories was paraded down the spring/summer 2018 catwalks. All Alessandra Rich\u2019s 1980s-reminiscent looks were topped off with either statement crystal earrings (from \u00a3190) or a crystal hairband (\u00a3235) \u2013 or indeed, both at the same time. For the less extrovert dresser, the Swarovski crystals placed along parted hair lines at Dries Van Noten were exquisitely discreet. At Versace, Donatella chose demure gold-tone hairpins (\u00a3190 each) for her models. And Simone Rocha\u2019s gorgeous faux-pearl clips (from \u00a375) would be a good choice for any chic summer bride; in jet, they lend glitter to an all-black evening look. \u201cI love their functionality,\u201d says Rocha. \u201cThey not only hold your hair in place but frame the face. Hair accessories can look regal on women of all ages.\u201d\n\nJewellers, too, are turning their attention to the art of hair adornment. Tilly Thomas Lux, the British brand that creates both seasonal and bespoke pieces for brides, caused a small sensation late last year with its Shooting Star hair jewels collection (\u00a3180 each). According to founder and designer Sally Thomas, women are buying her vintage-style crystal pins, handmade crowns and decorative combs not only for weddings, but also for evening events and galas.\n\nFor daytime chic, French fine jeweller Charlotte Chesnais, a former Balenciaga designer, has a collection of minimalist hair clips that serve as the perfect fastener for a low-key, Parisian-style chignon or a half ponytail. Her handmade egg (\u00a3180), turtle (\u00a3150) and shell (\u00a3200) designs are available in gold- or silver-plated brass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasingly popular are the hair piece designs created by London-based fine jewellery label Alighieri, which are inspired by Dante Alighieri\u2019s Divine Comedy. Rosh Mahtani, the brand\u2019s founder and designer, was inspired to make her own pieces when she couldn\u2019t find anything suitable for herself. Cast from 24ct-gold-plated bronze, these intriguing, storied accessories are made to order and include The Bea Hairband (\u00a3490), The Broken Memory Hairpin (\u00a3110) and The Long Game Hair Clip (\u00a3250). And according to Net-a-Porter\u2019s Aiken, The Over-Thinker Hair Tie (\u00a3195) is \u201cthe ultimate answer to a bad hair day\u201d. Perhaps not one from the Inferno, but nevertheless. This year it\u2019s time to get ahead with a beautiful hair accessory or two.", "sentiment": 0.22587600000000002, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Six ways to wear new-season hair accessories"}, {"published": "2018-06-17T07:30:00+01:00", "link": "https://howtospendit.ft.com/travel/203709-perfumer-lynn-harris-s-favourite-european-island", "text": "I discovered Ile-de-R\u00e9 several years ago, after my partner Christophe Michel and I sold our holiday house in Brittany \u2013where he grew up \u2013 because we wanted the freedom to discover new places with our son Henri, now 12. The first time we went was out of season; we spent days picnicking on the beaches with no one else around. It\u2019s a very simple way of life there \u2013 the air is so clean, the scent of the pine forests is amazing, and the light that bounces off the salt marshes is magical. It\u2019s not as perfect as the south of France; it feels much more wild and alive, with locals going about their daily business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe stay further north, in Ars-en-R\u00e9, which, with its whitewashed, light stone buildings and green shutters, is apparently considered one of France\u2019s most beautiful villages. We book a self-catering loft apartment in Le S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, a beautiful hotel owned by the architect Christophe Ducharme; it has a fireplace that\u2019s perfect after a day pottering around in the sea with our nets, returning all cold and the air at night a little bit damp. The hotel has a lovely feel, with the fa\u00e7ade of being quite traditional and old-fashioned, but inside it is stripped back and simple. It\u2019s like a home from home. There\u2019s a great deli and caf\u00e9, La Tour de S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, underneath the hotel, which sells beautiful things, and sometimes they cook and let you take it up to your room.\n\nWe hire bikes and cycle around the island \u2013 at just over 18 miles long and very flat, it\u2019s easy to cover much of it in a day. We\u2019ll go around Ars-en-R\u00e9\u2019s port, past the three traditional windmills, the Moulins de la Boire, and down to the barrenness of Le Bois-Plage, where beautiful forests and windswept dunes surround the fine-sand beach. The island is packed with amazing food and restaurants \u2013 we head north to Le Phare des Baleines, known locally as the Lighthouse of the Whales, for Le Caf\u00e9 du Phare underneath it. It\u2019s been there for years, just like one you\u2019d find in Paris, yet it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere. Oyster shacks line all the cycle paths on the island. The fruits de mer platters are out of this world at La Cabane du Fier; it\u2019s rustic and very French. Or we might go for a drink somewhere in town, taking in a spectacular sunset. I also like to rummage around Marie et Angele, an army surplus meets vintage store; I\u2019m drawn to its chic utilitarianism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIle-de-R\u00e9 is not just for tourists. It refreshes me subconsciously \u2013 sometimes the island\u2019s scents will inspire me, and I\u2019ll get out my pen and paper; but other times, I just want to sit there and absorb it all. Back in London, I\u2019ll look at things differently, and the ideas will flow.

But good fortune has blessed the island of Providencia more generously than almost anywhere I know \u2013 and the same good fortune extends to the few lucky souls who make it to this off-piste corner of the western Caribbean. Never was a place more aptly named.\n\nRural and slow-paced, Providencia is a virtually unique survivor (another I know of is Venezuela\u2019s Los Roques) of the Caribbean as it used to be before tourism swept across the region like a tropical storm. It\u2019s not easy to get to \u2013 which must be a major cause, as well as a guarantee, of its fine state of conservation. I arrived here on an 18-seater turboprop from San Andr\u00e9s, the larger neighbouring island (which in turn lies two hours away from Bogot\u00e1) \u2013 there\u2019s no other way by air \u2013 bumping along a pitted runway as the pilot bid us welcome and we all clapped wildly. My bags were delivered to the tin-pot terminal, essentially a beam-roofed barn, by tractor. Outside the door a girl with a big Afro and an even bigger smile held up a blackboard with my name written on it in Day-Glo pink chalk.\n\nOut on the road there were no cars to speak of: Marvin, my driver, claimed that Providencia has only about 100 vehicles. Bougainvillea, acacia and mango trees leant in over the concrete track from the gardens of one-storey clapboard houses, some with porches where folk sat placidly in white plastic chairs. A hen with her chicks bustled and clucked on the roadside. At one point Marvin stopped the car and wound down the window for a chat with his sister in a thick Creole English, concluding with, \u201cHe win big, big, big\u201d. I remembered that Colombia had held elections just the day before.\n\nAnd this is Colombia, indeed, but only by the skin of its teeth. The 5,000 inhabitants of Old Providence, as they know their island, are the descendants of slaves brought here by the British and have surnames like Williams, Bush and Brown. Spanish is very much a second language, and the island has little to do with mainland Colombia, economically, culturally or politically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also out on a limb in another sense. Isolation, poor communications and, historically, a lack of investment mean that large-scale tourism has never taken root on Providencia. Not counting a handful of basic B&Bs and beach hotels with names like Windy View and Ocean Paradise, there are only two desirable places to stay. One is Deep Blue, the island\u2019s single upmarket conventional hotel, which I found unassumingly modern but unpretentiously comfortable.\n\nThe other was to be my HQ over the long weekend I spent on Old Providence \u2013 a micro-hotel with just four rooms and two suites, sitting pretty on the island\u2019s north-east coast with its toes in the powder-blue sea. Monasterio del Viento (\u201cmonastery of the wind\u201d) has the look of what it once was: a seaside hideout belonging to a well-connected Colombian who relished the raw simplicity of this Caribbean Shangri-La. The owner was about to sell up in 2015 when his niece and her boyfriend stepped in, swapping the buzz of Bogot\u00e1 for the snooziness of far\u2011flung Providencia. Cristina Garc\u00eda de la Concha and Rodrigo Perry oversaw the change from house to hotelito, painting the walls bright white and picking out windows and doors in forget-me-not and aquamarine blue. The Monasterio\u2019s brightly coloured decorative flotsam and jetsam, the shells and knick-knacks, bring the whole thing marvellously close to kitsch, but remain charmingly true to the island\u2019s na\u00eff aesthetic.\n\nGarc\u00eda de la Concha and Perry describe their place as a \u201crustic luxury getaway\u201d, which sounds about right. The hotel has decks and terraces for dining, a small pool and a covered jetty over the water where, on my first night, Garc\u00eda de la Concha served me a supper of lobster brochetas and roast red snapper while I lounged on cushions in regal seclusion. After a week of stressful hustle in Bogot\u00e1, the island had succeeded in allowing me, for once, to think of absolutely nothing.\n\nThe Monasterio has no WiFi, Providencia being a desert island in the digital ocean where 4G has yet to make landfall. Guests have been known to go a little crazy, confided Garc\u00eda de la Concha, before they realise there are things that more than make up for the hotel\u2019s disconnectedness.\n\nSuch as the food. Old Providence has an interesting local cuisine, with traditional dishes like black-crab soup and johnny-cake, but young Perry, who has worked at the great Celler de Can Roca in Catalonia, is without doubt the island\u2019s leading food dude. I ate like a king at the Monasterio: my notebooks are full of ravings over his camarones encocados (prawns in coconut sauce), his fish ceviche with palm hearts, his crab turnovers with fresh chilli sauce. Supply is a permanent problem, but Perry makes good use of the island\u2019s native fruit and veg \u2013 yucca, breadfruit, guava, coconut \u2013 and, most of all, its amazing seafood, fished by artisan methods with hooks and harpoons. He works away in a galley kitchen behind the wooden bar, while Garc\u00eda de la Concha dispenses glasses of tamarind juice or cups of fine-flavoured Colombian coffee.\n\nOn Saturday at sundown I set out from the hotel on foot towards the village of Santa Isabel, crossing a rickety wooden bridge to the islet of Santa Catalina. The tin-roofed houses on the boardwalk rejoiced in their eye-popping shades of hot pink and fuchsia, mint green and canary yellow. At Big Mama Sweet Taste, a beach-shack bar on Santa Catalina, the owner was just settling into a hammock, bottle in hand. I made the brief climb up to Fort Warwick, a ruined castle supposed to have been the hideout of the 17th-century pirate Henry Morgan, and sat in the evening sun, looking out over the pinky-blue ocean. A Saturday jump-up was going on back in Santa Isabel, and the gentle thump of reggae drifted on the breeze.\n\nMore of the island\u2019s astounding beauty and state of preservation was revealed the next morning on a motor launch. Malcom [sic] Barker, my captain, wore a Marley T-shirt (Bob is big round here) and tucked his dreadlocks into a multicoloured topper. Chugging out towards the reef \u2013 which is said to be the world\u2019s third longest (at 32km) and one of its best preserved \u2013 Barker challenged me to identify the seven shades of blue to be seen in the waters around the atoll of Crab Cay, a tone-poem running from glassy green and pale turquoise all the way to Yves Klein and rich royal blue. From the top of the Cay I had a prime view of the island\u2019s surprising topography, its peaks and escarpments draped in dense vegetation. Such building as there was straggled sparsely along the coastal fringe.\n\nWe sped around the coast towards Manzanillo Beach, the island\u2019s prime playa and a Caribbean dream of coral sands as soft as icing sugar, gracefully leaning coconut palms and weatherbeaten beach bars serving cold Colombian beer and bowls of ceviche. At Roland\u2019s, the island\u2019s de facto social centre, a mighty sound system was pumping out dancehall. There\u2019d been a beach party the previous night and a fire pit was still smouldering among the palms. The eponymous Roland, mixing me a Cuba Libre, said he\u2019d been here on Manzanillo for 35 years, during which time the island had changed \u201cnot too much. And I\u2019m here to make sure it don\u2019t change too much in the future neither.\u201d\n\nProvidencia may be tiny, but its personalities are often larger than life. One afternoon I met up with singer-songwriter Elkin Robinson at his home in San Felipe, a beachside hamlet known locally as Lazy Hill. \u201cWelcome to the laziest place on the laziest island in the laziest part of the world,\u201d joked Robinson. In the creek beside his little house, three mottled-brown manta rays flapped slowly upstream.\n\nRobinson has studied the island\u2019s history and was happy to give me some edited highlights. Until 1641 Old Providence was an English colony \u2013 hence the Whittakers and Livingstones and Bushes \u2013 whose minuscule capital, Old Town, was fancifully named New Westminster. The island\u2019s cultural DNA is not Hispanic but African, and its music is a rich stew of calypso, Jamaican mento and reggae featuring indigenous instruments such as the washtub and horse jaw. Robinson took me outside on the porch, tuned up his guitar and sang a sweet song with a ska-like rhythm, Creole Vibration, about Providencia\u2019s powerful sense of identity and roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe island Robinson sings about is a precious fragment of the old Caribbean, but for how long can it stay this way? Providencia\u2019s neighbour San Andr\u00e9s has sadly fallen prey to uncontrolled development, devolved into a tacky and overpopulated party island with water shortages and a creaking infrastructure, where waves of incomers from Colombia\u2019s mainland cities, Cartagena and Barranquilla, now dwarf the local population. The inhabitants of Old Providence have observed that transformation with horror and are rightly suspicious of any plan that might impact negatively on their island. For the foreseeable future it seems there will be no further hotels; building and residence permits will continue to be rigorously controlled, and there\u2019ll be no extensions to the airport to allow bigger planes to fly in directly from Colombia\u2019s major cities. For the moment, this is simply a delectably quiet place in which to lie low and empty your head.\n\nThe extent of my own exertions over three days was a morning spent swimming with turtles on the reef, and another climbing The Peak, at 360m Providencia\u2019s highest mountain, with a Rasta called Elijah who showed me rare native plants and greeted passing walkers with \u201cPositive energy!\u201d\n\nWhat I mostly did was eat. With the end of my stay in sight, I hadn\u2019t tried conch, one of the island\u2019s signature specialities. But I was in luck: the maracas player in Robinson\u2019s band, a neighbour of his in Lazy Hill, had fished a bucketful that morning and brought some round to the Monasterio. Perry cooked them till tender in a herby sauce, with dumplings and a fishcake starter that both reminded me of the things this Caribbean outpost shares with Britain.\n\nAfter lunch I lay on the bed in my cool white room, idly comparing the soft whoosh of the ceiling fan with the plashing of the waves below the house. Given the lack of WiFi, checking my emails or Instagramming the morning\u2019s photos was out of the question. In fact, there was no urgent need to do anything or be anywhere but right here. Obligation was on vacation \u2013 and in its absence, Providencia had seeped into my soul.", "sentiment": 0.15096999999999997, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Isla de Providencia: the Caribbean the crowds don\u2019t know of"}, {"published": "2018-07-31T00:00:00", "link": "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/31/1533009600000/Is-a-change-goin--to-come-/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}, {"published": "2018-07-10T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/10/1531212680000/Universities-of-Britain--cosying-up-to-crypto-is-a-bad-look/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Universities of Britain: cosying up to crypto is a bad look"}, {"published": "2018-07-27T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/27/1532664000000/Musk-and-Tesla-are-not-inseparable/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Musk and Tesla are not inseparable"}, {"published": "2018-05-03T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/05/03/1525356824000/-Great-quarter-guys--/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\u201cGreat quarter guys!\u201d"}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/08/01/1533142800000/Little-birds-sing--the-Martin-Tripp-counterclaim/#comments", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": null}, {"published": "2018-06-04T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/06/04/1528084800000/Selling-an-unintelligible-dream-at-Tesla/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Selling an unintelligible dream at Tesla"}, {"published": "2018-07-08T08:00:00+01:00", "link": "https://howtospendit.ft.com/house-garden/203797-the-power-of-pink-interiors", "text": "The power of pink has proved remarkably resistant to the fickle fads of fashion. It has set the tone in successive seasons, and reappeared at this year\u2019s pageant of trend-setting design shows \u2013 most notably among the slick Scandi furniture of Stockholm \u2013 while the fashion pack was urged to think pink for spring/summer 2018 as everyone from Armani to Erdem sent models down the catwalk in a palette of blush shades.\n\nPink appeared on the design radar in 2016 as Pantone\u2019s Color Institute proclaimed Rose Quartz its Colour of the Year alongside Serenity, a complementary blue. The following spring it introduced Pale Dogwood, a similar but greyer tone. This palette \u2013 mixed with myriad spin-off shades \u2013 permeated the collective consciousness, appearing on everything from clothes to bags to cocktails and chairs. It became known as Millennial Pink after the young, discerning hipsters in its thrall and, as images of restaurants, hotels and private homes that had adopted the colour saturated social media sites, was then dubbed Tumblr Pink \u2013 in homage to the web platform of the same name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward to 2018, and while Pantone\u2019s colour wheel has turned to Ultra Violet, pink continues to inform the style of modern homes. \u201cPeople are continuing to search and save a wide range of ideas in this colour to try in their homes,\u201d says Larkin Brown, user researcher and house stylist at image-sharing website Pinterest. \u201cOver the past year (from April 2017 to April 2018) there has been a 165 per cent increase in \u201csaves\u201d for pink interiors. Pins for pink doors have risen by 75 per cent and those for pink tables by 145. This colour continues as a trend because it works when you want a versatile, neutral shade that softens any space.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s point resonated at this year\u2019s Stockholm Furniture Fair where Scandi Pink (another moniker for the phenomenon) appeared among the tasteful neutrals and blond woods on show. Swedish maker David Design complemented its bestselling Hammock chair (\u20ac521) with a new table (from \u20ac1,140) in pink linoleum or pink leather (each \u20ac1,700); Swedish textile company Kasthall updated its hand\u2011tufted Gry rug (\u00a3465 per sq m) in Rose Mist and introduced a new boucl\u00e9 corduroy (\u00a3377 per sq m) in Macaroon; while Stockholm designer Asplund chose a cool candy colour for its Petit Palais table (from \u20ac1,376).\n\nPink also made the mix in the earthy palette of colours highlighted as a trend at the fair. \u201cWe\u2019ll see pink for quite some time,\u201d says designer Emma Olbers, a creative director at Swedish firm Ire. \u201cWe need spaces that are calm \u2013 and these earthy colours ranging from dusty pink to 1970s matte brown, wine red and warm beige are a big trend in Scandinavia.\u201d Consequently, two of Olbers\u2019 latest pieces, the Sofo Upper sofa (SKr34,490, about \u20ac3,370) and the Estrid armchair (\u20ac2,828), are upholstered in dusky-pink velvet.\n\n\u201cFor the past 20 years, white and grey have dominated Scandinavian design, but 100 years ago our castles and aristocratic homes featured these earthy colours,\u201d Olbers adds, recalling the late-19th-century Swedish painter Carl Larsson, whose scenes of domestic and rural idylls were realised in a palette of pastels. \u201cHis colours marry well. They feel very honest \u2013 and in the same way as we have welcomed natural materials like wood and stone back into our homes, we are seeing soothing earth tones used on walls. I think they fulfil a deep need in us.\u201d\n\nFellow Swede Daniel Heckscher, an interior architect and partner at Note Design Studio, has something of a reputation as a colour maestro. \u201cEven Stockholm on the coldest winter day is full of colour, so I have never understood why for the past 40 years the typical minimal Scandinavian interior has taken all that away,\u201d he says. Heckscher embraced a pink palette when creating the centrepiece bar at the Stockholm Fair last year, and used the colour to \u201cbreak with tradition\u201d when designing the interiors of the Mono residential development in the city\u2019s artsy S\u00f6dermalm district. \u201cI find Swedish functionalism a little oppressive, and I think other people are also moving away from white. They choose it because they are afraid of making a mistake.\u201d\n\nHeckscher\u2019s own apartment in the suburb of Saltsj\u00f6baden is a tasteful composition of muted, unexpected colours, which were originally dictated by the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather ugly 1980s structure with a pinkish-orange fa\u00e7ade. I decided that the best way to deal with it was to bring the exterior colour into the space. My daughter, who was two at the time, also had a say \u2013 and she wanted pink.\u201d\n\nHeckscher studied at the Istituto Europeo di Design in Milan, and the cityscape\u2019s patchwork of pinks, terracottas and ochres inform his colour choices. Indeed, 250 years before bloggers blazed a trail of pink across the internet, the early-18th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo was decorating the city\u2019s churches and grand palazzi with theatrical depictions of peachy nymphs and angels floating on fluffy clouds. In 2010, Italian art critic Roberto Calasso wrote the book Tiepolo Pink and claimed the artist symbolised \u201cthe last breath of happiness in Europe\u201d, with his light touch, absence of brimstone and fire. After the French Revolution the artist\u2019s rococo optimism looked na\u00efve and outmoded, but as Calasso asserts, \u201cLike all true happiness, it was full of dark sides destined not to fade away, but to get the upper hand.\u201d\n\nDoes our current passion for pink symbolise a similarly frivolous and decadent era? Are we as sybaritic as our rococo ancestors? We are, collectively at least, more narcissistic and the \u201cselfie\u201d culture plays a big part in the enduring popularity of pink. \u201cEveryone looks great when backlit with pink,\u201d says Oona Bannon, one half of British furniture maker Pinch \u2013 which is perhaps the reason why wallpaper specialists such as De Gournay have embraced the colour in recent collections (\u00a3942 per 915mm-wide panel). \u201cIt appears in nature, in flowers and in sunsets. I think this adds up to us seeing it \u2013 even subconsciously \u2013 as an anti-technology colour,\u201d Bannon continues. The design studio chose a striking rose-coloured marquetry for its new Elan armoire (\u00a38,450), which it launched during Milan Design Week in April. \u201cWe went for tones that are relaxing, flattering and gentle,\u201d says Bannon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe colour certainly popped up in the most unexpected places during the design fair: from the pink onyx and glass lift in the Prada Foundation\u2019s new Torre \u2013 designed by architect Rem Koolhaas and opened to the public for the first time \u2013 to the Palazzo Bocconi where Louis Vuitton created a cascade of paper flowers on the ceiling as a backdrop to its ongoing Objets Nomades collection of limited edition pieces. Here, several of its existing designs such as its Bomboca sofa (\u00a347,500) by the Campana brothers were presented in pink. Its new Les Petits Nomades collection, meanwhile, included a leather vase (price on request) with a fuchsia interior, also by the Campana brothers.\n\nArtemest, the e-tailer specialising in handmade Italian decor, commissioned 48 makers to create pink pieces, which it displayed in an elegant 1930s villa. \u201cIt\u2019s the colour of the moment \u2013 sophisticated yet fun. It expresses a contemporary idea of beauty,\u201d says Artemest co-founder and creative director Ippolita Rostagno. At Moroso, British designer Bethan Laura Wood channelled her love of Mexico into a selection of vibrant textiles, furniture and tapestries where neon pinks popped amid olive greens and pastels of every shade, while at the Alcova exhibition of experimental design, former jewellery designer Lara Bohinc presented her first collection of chairs designed as \u201cfloating discs reminiscent of puffy marshmallows caught between a strong but delicate frame\u201d and manufactured in collaboration with London gallery Matter of Stuff.\n\nItalian mosaic maestro Bisazza cranked up the colour wheel with its punchy pink bathroom \u2013 a creation by designer-architect India Mahdavi that could have been teleported from a Wes Anderson film set. The comparison is even more flattering when one considers that most of the winners at this year\u2019s Pinterest UK Interior Awards were influenced by the American director\u2019s flair for colour. Mahdavi\u2019s strawberry suite, presented on a candy-coloured, pinstripe mosaic backdrop, is a bold encore to the more muted Groove and New Malachite mosaics created for Bisazza last year by Australian designer Greg Natale. \u201cClients are increasingly brave when it comes to using colours, prints and textures in their bathrooms,\u201d says Rossella Bisazza, head of communications. \u201cPink has been a big trend for a couple of years now and it\u2019s sticking around, which is why we believe these collections will appeal.\u201d\n\nHarry Nuriev \u2013 Russian architect, colour maestro and founder of Crosby Studios \u2013 has been similarly colour confident in his bathroom designs, creating a contemporary pink ensuite in a Moscow apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s still one of the most popular pictures on my website, and one of the most liked Instagrams on Interior Design magazine\u2019s feed,\u201d he says.\n\nHow times have changed. When Slovenian furniture designer Nika Zupanc launched her pink Lolita light (from \u00a3625) for Moooi in Milan in 2008, it was \u201can act of rebellion\u201d accompanied by the slogan: Who is afraid of pink? \u2013 an in-your-face provocation. \u201cI actually thought Lolita might damage my career,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAt that time, pink was seen as too frivolous, too girly, not high-tech or smart enough for the design world. But perhaps because it was forbidden, designers began to use it and the negative connotations gradually fell away. Now it\u2019s everywhere, it has transcended meaning. It\u2019s like yellow or green \u2013 a liberated colour.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, but will pink ever be free of its gender-specific associations? Millennial Pink \u2013 appealing to both men and women \u2013 is certainly viewed as \u201cgender neutral\u201d, a colour synonymous with gender fluidity and appreciated by a generation for whom sexuality is on a spectrum. This September, Pink: The History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Colour opens at New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology. The show will explore how the pink-for-girls, blue-for-boys code has flipped back and forth over the centuries through a display of around 80 outfits dating from 1857 to the present day. And the last time the colour held such unisex appeal was in 18th-century Europe.\n\nIf pink has transcended trends \u2013 taking its place alongside cream, white and grey in colour\u2019s royal box of neutrals \u2013 what\u2019s next in the changing colour wheel? Fashion houses from Balenciaga to Gucci have already sent Ultra Violet down the runway, but it is yet to have traction in interiors. There is a subtle shift at the pink end of the scale towards warmer tones from salmon to peach, and even orange. This may be a tone too far for some, but either way the future looks peachy.", "sentiment": 0.2520846153846154, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "The power of pink interiors"}, {"published": "2018-06-11T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/06/11/1528689600000/Zion-Oil--Living-on-a-prayer/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Zion Oil: Living on a prayer"}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/08/01/1533137715000/A-few-ideas-for-fixing-GDP/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  "}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/08/02/1533192839000/Further-reading/#comments", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": null}, {"published": "2018-07-05T12:30:00+01:00", "link": "https://howtospendit.ft.com/womens-style/203777-the-renaissance-of-haute-couture", "text": "For almost as long as I\u2019ve been a journalist (a mighty long time), fashion writers have been heralding the death of haute couture. As regularly as the weather reports would come doom-laden stories about the dwindling band of clients who had both the lifestyles and the deep pockets that the grand couture houses needed if they were to survive. \u201cAh me,\u201d the pundits would wail, \u201cwhat will happen to the skills, the crafts, the ateliers, the jobs and [of course] the bank balances of the couture houses?\u201d But it occurred to me recently that I hadn\u2019t read such a story for quite some time.\n\nCouture, it seems, is thriving. It has changed, of course. It\u2019s no longer the preserve of European grand aristocracy and old money. Fortune magazine tells me that in the US alone, 1,700 millionaires are created every day, while according to Investopedia, a new billionaire is made every other day around the world. Of course, not all new money is likely to gravitate towards couture, but there\u2019s enough wealth to keep the couture houses going and enough individuals happy to pay for something unique, made just for them. All this means that a host of new names is joining some of the grandest of the grand couture houses.\n\nHaute couture, as we all know, is not the same thing as couture or custom made. To qualify as an haute couture house, an appellation the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture guards as closely as if it were protecting the Holy Grail, a maison has to fulfil a number of demanding criteria. Today there are 14 members (among the most famous of which are Dior and Chanel), but there are also a number of \u201cguest members\u201d, who are invited to show in Paris at Haute Couture Fashion Week.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a changing of the guard at many of the big fashion names. At Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller, designer of Meghan Markle\u2019s dress for her wedding to Prince Harry in May, has taken the reins as the first female artistic director, and in January produced her first ever haute couture collection (price on request), which received a rapturous reception from the press. \u201c\u2026rigorous, intelligent and smart,\u201d wrote the Financial Times\u2019 fashion editor Jo Ellison. \u201cTo find her spare aesthetic, she had revisited many of the 1950s couture shapes first developed by the house\u2019s founder Hubert de Givenchy before \u2018chopping them up and reimagining\u2019 them. Floating chiffon skirts were toughened up with sharp tailoring and rollneck sweaters, a silvery beaded gown shimmered under an oversized coat: the equilibrium between tailleur and flou was perfectly tempered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther fashion houses outside the haute couture circle also see a future for couture. At C\u00e9line, new artistic director Hedi Slimane has announced that he\u2019ll be adding couture to the repertoire, and Balmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing \u2013 whose ready-to-wear collections are driven by what has been called a \u201ccouture spirit\u201d, with attention to hand-wrought detailing \u2013 launched a demi-couture range for spring/summer. Meanwhile, the wonderfully cerebral Dutch designer Iris van Herpen dropped ready-to-wear back in 2016 to focus only on her extraordinarily avant-garde interpretation of couture (price on request).\n\nAt the same time in the UK, Giles Deacon also turned his business into couture only (price on request). \u201cWhen the arrangement I had with licensees for my ready-to-wear business in Italy ran out, I decided I would concentrate on the things I love doing, which is showpieces, bridal dresses, special bespoke designs,\u201d he says. \u201cWe make everything in London, using silk from Suffolk, horsehair from Somerset and so on. My aesthetic is much honed by the British tradition and inspired by people such as Norman Hartnell. I love tailoring and evening dresses.\u201d\n\nAnother London-based couturier, Deborah Milner, who for many years worked with Alexander McQueen and since 2004 has been a consultant with the house, opened her own small studio a couple of years ago in London\u2019s Pimlico, where she makes exquisite pieces (from about \u00a35,000) for her band of faithful clients. Milner believes the new wave of fashion designers and talented graduates keen to work in couture are key factors in its revival, along with their enthusiasm for reimagining couture for the modern age. \u201cThey are interested in the craft, they want to learn how to do it and to make beautiful things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the sketches \u2013 they want to learn all about pattern making, the cut, the finishing details.\u201d\n\nAs for couture\u2019s appeal to its new generation of clients, Milner says, \u201cIt\u2019s about showcasing the artistry of couture. Being able to have something unique that can\u2019t be easily copied. The high-end, ready-to-wear designs are imitated so quickly and cheaply by high-street chains. Our challenge is to adapt designs and make them relevant to today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nMilner started out working with Philip Treacy at the late Isabella Blow\u2019s house and there she was introduced to women who became her clients; many are still with her today. Perhaps the best known is Daphne Guinness, who has been a fan for over 20 years. \u201cShe is one of the few people I know who actually understands how a piece of clothing should be made,\u201d says Guinness. \u201cShe is an architect. She is one of a kind, an artist. She\u2019s up there with Vionnet, Madame Gr\u00e8s and McQueen.\u201d\n\nHer clients come to her mostly for suits, jackets, tailcoats (she\u2019s made an extraordinary one covered in sequins for Guinness) or evening dresses and she has a host of specialist artisans she turns to for the embroidery, beading and handmade lace (including traditional craftspeople in Slovenia who make very unusual pieces).\n\nAnother McQueen prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Lee Paton, started out in ready-to-wear and still offers what he calls high-end luxury ready-to-wear. However, he found that \u201cmore and more women were asking me for special one-off pieces. It was demand that set me up. What I like about couture is that there is no limit on budget, so I can create truly beautiful pieces.\u201d His clients come to him for all sorts of items. \u201cOne woman wanted a truly lovely bespoke tailored jacket, and for \u00a325,000 that\u2019s what she got,\u201d recalls Paton. \u201cI encrusted it with sequins and embroideries. There was a huge hand-embroidered rose on the back. She told me the jacket had made her feel like a princess for the first time in her life.\u201d\n\nPaton, too, thinks the fact that couture has lost its old-fashioned, stuffy associations has made it much more appealing to a new breed of customer. \u201cI now make embellished T-shirts that become wearable art.\u201d His clients can become immersed in the process in his studio as he creates everything in-house. He uses wools and tweeds from Yorkshire and the Highlands, while silk, lace and cotton come from France. Paton considers his aesthetic a \u201cmixture of traditional British elegance and tailoring with detailed hand finishing inspired by the couture techniques of the early Parisian ateliers\u201d.\n\nPeter Dundas, former artistic director at Roberto Cavalli, recently launched what he calls a \u201ccouture ideology in ready-to-wear\u201d, which he showed during Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week and sells on Matchesfashion.com and Moda Operandi (\u00a33,860). But just like Deacon, Milner and Paton, Dundas also designs couture for a select group of clients, relishing the opportunity to create spectacular one-off designs (from \u20ac14,500). He describes his work as being \u201cmuch more for the night\u201d, which is to say he is best known for very glamorous, very sexy eveningwear (he created Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2017 Grammys performance dress and, under the Emilio Pucci name, Poppy Delevingne\u2019s wedding dress).\n\nMeanwhile, designer Osman Yousefzada \u2013 who made his name with a strong, sculptural, almost architectural approach to clothing \u2013 opened the new Osman townhouse in March in London\u2019s Fitzrovia. For his many clients (such as Helen Mirren, Charlize Theron, Felicity Jones and Livia Firth) there is an atelier for consultations, but, in addition, it\u2019s also a cultural space with an art gallery, bookshop and ready-to-wear boutique. \u201cThe idea,\u201d he says, \u201cis to fill the gap and offer clothes that aren\u2019t available in the ready-to-wear line. I don\u2019t dress shrinking violets. My customers come to me for my strong tailoring, where the cut and fit are terribly important. My couture clothing has much the same aesthetic, but it means I can make pieces that are more fun, more special and really beautiful.\u201d\n\nJet Shenkman\u2019s Eponine label has long been a well-kept secret among the inhabitants of London\u2019s W8 and W11 districts, but ever since the Duchess of Cambridge was photographed in one of Eponine\u2019s signature tweed outfits, the rest of the world has come calling. Last year Shenkman opened a showroom-cum-studio in Kensington, where she has a selection of her most popular designs (from \u00a31,900). Her speciality is incorporating rare tribal textiles into her bespoke dresses. She also has a cache of vintage kimonos, which she works into her one-off frocks, and this summer she cut vintage Russian Cossack blouses into her designs.\n\nCelia Kritharioti is based in the Plaka district of Athens, where her family owns the oldest Greek fashion house (designs from \u00a310,000). It opened its doors in 1906 (which makes it older than Chanel), and Kritharioti grew up immersed in the world of couture. She believes the revival of couture is a reaction to the negative effects of globalisation. \u201cYou find the same shoes, handbags and labels on every high street in every country,\u201d she says. \u201cThe people who come to me don\u2019t want to look like all their friends. They want something different.\u201d She presented her first couture collection in Paris (at the Ritz hotel) during Haute Couture Fashion Week a year ago and this January she returned for the second time, showing a glorious confection of feminine dresses for grand occasions. She\u2019s mostly known for her elaborate ball and wedding gowns, with lots of lace, embroidery and sequins, but also beautiful bias-cut gowns with dramatic bows and draping.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Kritharioti has been coming regularly to London for one-on-one appointments with a growing number of clients. Her designs are true red-carpet statements, creations only a couture house could make, sought after by many a star of stage and screen. Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow are among her fans.\n\nFinally, Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko, who in 2012 was invited to present in Paris by the Chambre Syndicale and has done so ever since, visits the UK several times a year either to see clients in their own homes or to host trunk shows (such as those at Moda Operandi\u2019s Knightsbridge showroom). Sergeenko says her clients look to couture because they \u201cwant to dream \u2013 they want something that is truly beautiful.\u201d She finds some customers look to her for a complete wardrobe. She has created over 300 designs for one very high-profile family alone. All her work (dresses from about \u20ac14,000) is heavily inspired by Russian fairytales and artisanal skills. \u201cI use lace makers whose craft dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries. I like to bring these beautiful things from the past into the modern world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaute couture, far from being in its death throes, is off the critical list and thriving. Led by some of the world\u2019s most talented designers, couture in the 21st century is making itself fit for the modern world and for the contemporary lifestyles of its well-heeled customers.", "sentiment": 0.2753546666666667, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "The renaissance of haute couture"}, {"published": "2018-07-16T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/16/1531740953000/Just-how-many-dimensions-of-chess-is-Elon-Musk-playing--/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Just how many dimensions of chess is Elon Musk playing?

There was your career, there was your social life and there were holidays. And each had a wardrobe to match. Yet in recent years, the increasing interest in healthy eating, fitness and mental health has blurred the boundaries between work, working out and socialising, calling for a new type of clothing that covers all bases. The solution has come in the form of the booming athleisurewear trend, which is expected to be an $83bn business by 2020.\n\nNow in the same way that Lululemon leggings are an acceptable wear-everywhere item, experts are predicting that \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cathbeauty\u201d will soon breach the threshold of the changing room door to become a mainstream product category.\n\n\u201cBeauty is breaking free from the confines of cosmetics and skincare,\u201d says Victoria Buchanan, strategic researcher at The Future Laboratory. \u201cIt\u2019s taking its place in the modern wellness pantheon, incorporating aspects of fashion\u2019s athleisure trend, the food sector\u2019s obsession with all-natural products and the health and fitness industry\u2019s drive towards optimisation and mindfulness.\u201d Vivienne Rudd, director of insights, beauty and personal care at Mintel, agrees that a shift in the consumer mindset means that women increasingly treat their body as a holistic \u201csystem\u201d, thinking not merely about surface appearances, but their integral \u201cskin and hair fitness\u201d. So the benefits of \u201cathbeauty\u201d products are manifold \u2013 whether one works out or not.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the matter of performance. Just as a sweat-wicking fabric keeps the body cool and dry when working out, new beauty formulations also offer targeted solutions for before, during and after exercise as body temperature, blood circulation and sweat production increase. Products are often multifunctional too, promising to streamline our beauty routine and lighten our load, with take\u2011everywhere packaging or mini sets that minimise the need for water or fiddly make-up brushes and other tools. And let\u2019s not forget the prevalence of fitness-inspired looks \u2013 from fresh-faced \u201csporty skin\u201d to the flushed \u201cpost-yoga glow\u201d showcased on the Isabel Marant and Stella McCartney catwalks over the past few seasons. It\u2019s a call to action that means looking healthy and active is the current beauty ideal \u2013 even if you\u2019re not a dedicated gym bunny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe rise of the sporty beauty look reflects the desire to appear and feel strong, energised and resilient as women go about their busy and increasingly more nomadic lives, switching between home, work and travel,\u201d says Jen Chamberlain, who heads up Procter & Gamble\u2019s global trend division. \u201cSo whether you exercise on a daily basis or simply live and breathe a hectic lifestyle, athleisure beauty will fit seamlessly into your busy world.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Aum Aromatherapy\u2019s Activate Body Mist (\u00a326 for 100ml) contains citrus and eucalyptus to energise \u2013 whether it\u2019s before working out or for a boost when feeling frazzled. Apply it directly to the skin, mist onto a yoga mat or use it as a room spray \u2013 you can also carry it in your bag as a pick-me-up throughout the day.\n\nLikewise Yuni, founded by yoga teachers, is a brand that brings benefits both during and post exercise. The Hot Head Microveil Hair Treatment (\u00a325 for 120ml) is a heat-activated mist that responds as body temperature rises and the hair cuticle opens. Rich in argan and kukui oils, the treatment conditions and hydrates hair as you condition your body. It even contains calming frankincense and lavender aromatherapy oils to enhance the meditative elements of yoga. Then there\u2019s the Sweat, Refresh & Go mini set (\u00a332) containing water-free Shower Sheet Body Wipes, a Flash Bath No-Rinse Body Cleanser, Chillax Muscle Recovery Gel and My Om World Aromatic Body Mist \u2013 which all come in a cotton bag that\u2019s as handy for holidays and business trips as it is for working out.\n\nYuni, available from e-tailer Cult Beauty, is part of a dedicated \u201cworkout beauty\u201d edit that Alexia Inge, Cult Beauty co-founder, decided to launch when her data analytics team reported a 113 and 247 per cent increase in year-on-year customer searches for these types of products. Similarly, extensive consumer insight research by Clinique convinced the prestige beauty brand that women wanted solutions specifically targeted towards an active lifestyle. The result was a capsule collection called CliniqueFit.\n\nMindful of a common tendency to use a harsh cleanser or scrub to rid skin of sweat, grease and shine after exercise, the CliniqueFit range includes a Post-Workout Mattifying Moisturizer (\u00a318 for 40ml). Containing a natural sugar called trehalose, it acts as a skin protector and delivers antioxidants to neutralise the skin-damaging free radicals that are produced during a workout. \u2018\u2018The release of sweat, salt and nitrogen onto the skin surface during exercise provides a natural detoxification. Yet the loss of moisture and lipids can deplete the skin, leaving it dry,\u201d says Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Tom Mammone, vice president of skin physiology and pharmacology. \u201cSo, counterintuitively, the period post-exercise is when the skin really needs moisture and restorative antioxidants to hydrate, feed and protect it against degradation.\u201d\n\nFree from sweat and properly moisturised, you could follow with CliniqueFit Post-Workout Neutralizing Face Powder (\u00a319.50). Like a breathable running vest for the face, it\u2019s lightweight, yet contains just enough yellow-based pigments to counteract flushing, so you don\u2019t arrive at your morning meeting quite literally red-faced. It also comes with an in-built sponge applicator, so you can dab it on, blend and go.\n\nAnd looking to the future, Mammone hints that Clinique is already talking to sports apparel and tech companies about the prospect of sensor-enabled clothing that sends data concerning skin temperature and hydration levels to a synchronised app, with instructions to release certain conditioning agents onto the skin at any given time.\n\nMintel\u2019s Rudd expects brands to also turn attention to HEV \u2013 High Energy Visible or blue light \u2013 which has been linked to skin pigmentation, dullness and the development of fine lines. Crucially, says Rudd, HEV is not only emitted by digital devices, but often by gym lighting too. So, products like Uriage\u2019s Age Protect Multi-Action Cream SPF 30 (\u00a328.50 for 40ml) with blue-light protection will form a key part of skincare routines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother important component of athleisure beauty is its convenience factor. Sarirah Hamid, founder of global beauty forecasting company Pretty Analytics, predicts the rise of products such as IGK Hair\u2019s anti-frizz Swipe Up Smoothing Hair Wipes and anti-humidity Charcoal Dry Shampoo Hair Blotting Tissues (both \u00a316 for 16), Mai Couture\u2019s shine-absorbing, press-on Makeup Papiers (\u00a315.50 for 50), and Arrow\u2019s oil-free Revive Cooling Cheek Tint (\u00a314). Minus the need for gym membership, these products can create the requisite post\u2011exercise look and slip discreetly between the sheets of a notebook or into a clutch bag.\n\n\u201cIdeas about what constitutes luxury beauty are changing rapidly,\u201d says Hamid. \u201cNow it\u2019s not always about price point.

Now, it seems, nothing touches vitamin C in terms of plumping, lifting and protection. It increases collagen production, in turn intensifying volume to lift skin and minimise fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a champion brightener \u2013 tackling dark spots, pigmentation and dull skin. Vitamin C also reduces inflammation and serves as a potent antioxidant, protecting against environmental damage caused by free radicals. The good news doesn\u2019t stop there: it may also help protect skin from precancerous changes from UV-light exposure due to its ability to neutralise free radicals.\n\n\u201cVitamin C is the miracle ingredient,\u201d says Dr Joel Rubin, senior vice president of DCL (Dermatologic Cosmetics Laboratory) skincare. \u201cIt\u2019s a fibroblast proliferator that produces collagen in the dermis, which firms the skin, while also protecting existing collagen by acting as a strong antioxidant. It is the most flawless active ingredient I know.\u201d\n\nMintel reported that 23 per cent of the vitamin C skincare products on the market were launched last year, a hike of 26 per cent since 2013. And according to Pretty Analytics, a trend insight company, 283,000 skincare videos posted on YouTube featured vitamin C, a 189 per cent increase between 2016 and 2017. Pinterest has also reported a rise of 3,380 per cent in saves for \u201cvitamin C serum\u201d in the last year.\n\nYet vitamin C as a beauty booster is not new. Practitioners in Ayurvedic medicine, according to Abida Halsentenberg, founder of Samaya Ayurveda Skincare, have known this for generations. \u201cIn India, my great-great-grandmother would have kilos of Indian gooseberry \u2013 amla \u2013 juiced as a beauty supplement, because it contains 20 times the vitamin C of an orange. I include organic amla in all Samaya skincare supplements.\u201d\n\nBut historically, vitamin C has been hard to deliver as an active ingredient because it is rendered inactive when exposed to light and air. That changed early this century when the late Dr Sheldon Pinnell, SkinCeuticals\u2019 leading scientist, developed a patent called A Stable Solution of L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and, in 2005, launched SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic (\u00a3135), a serum with 15 per cent L-ascorbic acid vitamin C. To this day, it is the brand\u2019s bestseller. Vitamin C serums followed from cosmeceutical doctors Perricone, Sebagh and Murad.\n\nBut what has brought on this next generation of vitamin C-based skincare? \u201cVitamin C is an incredible anti-ageing ingredient,\u201d says Dr Maryam Zamani of MZ Skin. \u201cWe now have many more studies and multiple trials to discover how vitamin C performs and at what concentration levels. There are many different vehicles for delivering the actives and formulations are much more stable than they were.\u201d\n\nIn a highly competitive industry, how skincare companies achieve this remains a closely guarded secret. There are also various types of vitamin C formulations (including L-ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate and retinyl ascorbate) and the choice used is a hotly contested issue.\n\nLixirskin founder Dr Colette Haydon has created Vitamin C Paste (\u00a332) with 10 per cent L-ascorbic acid. \u201cThe L is important because it is much purer and more effective. It\u2019s an expensive L, three times more expensive than ascorbic acid, but it\u2019s the real McCoy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Des Fernandes, Environ skincare founder, disagrees, claiming, \u201cAscorbyl tetraisopalmitate is a fat\u2011soluble form of vitamin C, which is more stable than L-ascorbic acid and can be used in much higher concentrations. It penetrates the skin more easily than L-ascorbic acid and is anti-inflammatory.\u201d\n\nThe base of a vitamin C product is also a crucial component: Dr Rubin maintains it needs to be anhydrous (free of water) or otherwise its efficacy will be compromised. \u201cVitamin C has been known to ionise in water,\u201d says Dr Rubin. \u201cThe pH changes immediately and the activity starts to degrade.\u201d Other brands claim to have cracked the code and have formulations that contain water, such as Vichy\u2019s LiftActiv Vitamin C Brightening Skin Corrector (\u00a328).\n\nThe percentage of vitamin C included in formulations is also up for debate. Dr Zamani explains her selection criteria when formulating her MZ Skin Brighten & Perfect 10% Vitamin C Corrective Serum (\u00a3245). \u201cI chose ascorbic tetraisopalmitate at 10 per cent, which isn\u2019t the strongest, but I was looking for a good efficacy combined with a luxurious experience.\u201d Hitting the spot for NeoStrata\u2019s Exuviance AF Vitamin C20 Serum Capsules (\u00a359) is 20 per cent L-ascorbic acid. \u201cWe chose 20 per cent because it\u2019s the maximum level that can be absorbed into skin,\u201d says Marisa Dufort, director of product development and ingredient innovation at NeoStrata.\n\nDr Rubin, however, strongly disputes this claim, championing a 30 per cent concentration of L-ascorbic acid in his DCL C Scape High Potency Night Booster 30 (\u00a3108). \u201cThe fact that we were able to get this percentage into a product simply means it is more effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the differences of opinion among skincare experts, what\u2019s important to remember is that any percentage of vitamin C will benefit the skin,\u201d says Paula Begoun, creator of Paula\u2019s Choice Resist C15 Super Booster (\u00a345), which contains 15 per cent. \u201cAnd just as different foods containing vitamin C are all good for you, one type of vitamin C isn\u2019t better than others.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, active vitamin C is derived from fruits and vegetables synthesised in laboratories. The latest botanical sources include schisandra red berry extract found in Lanc\u00f4me R\u00e9nergie Multi\u2011Glow (\u00a364) and kakadu plum found in both Oilixia Australian Gummy Facial Cleanser (\u00a324) and Jurlique Radiance Renewal 28 Day Programme (\u00a360). \u201cKakadu plum is trending right now,\u201d says Anna-Marie Solowij, CEO and co-founder of BeautyMart. \u201cIt has the highest recorded levels of natural vitamin C.\u201d\n\nAs for when to apply, Dr Haydon says she developed Lixirskin Vitamin C Paste as a two-minute morning mask. \u201cVitamin C has a magical ability to reduce the \u2018urban-grey\u2019 appearance which comes from the skin\u2019s dead cells of oxidised sebum and proteins.\u201d\n\nOthers advocate after-dark application. \u201cFor years, consumers have been taught to use vitamin C during the day as it increases radiance to the skin,\u201d says Dr Rubin. \u201cBut, in my opinion, it\u2019s more effective at night because then the skin is able to load up on all its benefits without sacrificing any effectiveness from exposure to UV.\u201d Designed as a night cream, his DCL C Scape High Potency claims to brighten, tighten and reduce the appearance of dark spots.\n\nWhatever time of day you prefer, there\u2019s plenty of vitamin C-charged serums, oils and moisturisers to choose from. Space NK\u2019s biggest skincare launch of last year was facialist Sunday Riley\u2019s CEO C + E antiOXIDANT Protect + Repair Moisturiser (\u00a360) and Rapid Flash Serum (\u00a370), while Dr Dennis Gross\u2019s C + Collagen skincare collection (from \u00a339) featured within its top 10 skincare launches. Clinique is also enjoying impressive sales of the Fresh Pressed 7 Day System with Pure Vitamin C (\u00a325), a week-long, two-step boot camp for dull and lined skin. The powder cleanser followed by a booster of 10 per cent vitamin C is so successful, according to Dr Tom Mammone, executive director of skin physiology and pharmacology, \u201cwe\u2019re currently working on a 25 per cent version\u201d.\n\nCarita\u2019s new Les Pr\u00e9cis skincare boosters (\u00a349.50) include a 10 per cent vitamin C serum that can be applied beneath or over make-up, while SkinDoc Formula\u2019s Day Watch (\u00a3120), by plastic surgeon Dr Dirk Kremer, has 20 per cent vitamin C. Launched this March, Elemis\u2019 Superfood skincare range sources the ingredient from broccoli and avocado for its gel Facial Wash (\u00a325); and Eve Lom Radiance Face Oil (\u00a360) is enriched with vitamin C.\n\nVitamin C is now making a move into other realms of the beauty business. British hair supremo Daniel Galvin has developed an in-salon Detox Miracle Solution Treatment (\u00a317) that he says removes pollutants and product build-up with one hefty dose of vitamin C. \u201cThe natural pH of vitamin C allows it to enter the cuticle. It identifies anything that isn\u2019t part of the hair\u2019s natural make-up and gently removes it, while simultaneously closing the cuticle.\u201d And Guerlain is leading the way in terms of synergising vitamin C into make-up. The brand infused the ingredient within its summer collection of six Terracotta bronzers (\u00a337) and Terracotta R\u00eave d\u2019Et\u00e9 tinted bronzing gel (\u00a334).\n\nAs for the future of beauty and skincare, vitamin C is not going away. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect ingredient,\u201d says Dr Rubin. \u201cNow, how often do you hear a cosmetic scientist say that?\u201d", "sentiment": 0.4902192307692305, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "Vitamin C: skincare\u2019s new wonder ingredient"}, {"published": "2018-08-02T00:00:00", "link": "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/08/02/1533216553000/The-model--the-medallions-and-David-Boies/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}, {"published": "2018-07-31T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/marketslive/2018-07-31/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  "}, {"published": "2018-08-01T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/08/01/1533096000000/-Of-course--many-ridiculous-papers-appeared-/#comments", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": null}, {"published": "2018-07-17T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/17/1531829447000/The-Netflix-dilemma/", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": "The Netflix dilemma -- updated"}, {"published": "2018-07-27T00:00:00", "link": "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/27/1532695685000/Some-help-please/#comments", "text": "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "sentiment": 0.30583333333333335, "interpretation": "neutral", "title": null}, {"published": "2018-07-16T15:00:00+01:00", "link": "https://howtospendit.ft.com/travel/203847-journey-into-mongolia-on-an-adventure-with-nomadic-herders", "text": "My first meal in Mongolia took place on the fourth floor of an office tower in a sleekly tricked-up steakhouse, where the menu featured Wagyu beef and Umbrian porcini and hits of the 1980s and \u201990s played at near thumping volume. It wasn\u2019t quite the setting I had expected for my maiden repast in the country. The ruthless beauty of the steppes, streaked with the vivid green of late spring; wide skies, full of fast-moving clouds and diving, kiting raptors; bracing winds and endless space; and perhaps some mutton, seared over an open fire \u2013 these were more the elements I\u2019d envisaged. Mongolia was a country I\u2019d dreamt of visiting since I was about 11 years old, watching an episode of Wild Kingdom in which nomadic herders careened joyfully on their sturdy horses across a landscape so huge and so empty my mind struggled to process it. Everything about it captivated: the eagle hunters and shamans, the caravans of woolly Bactrian camels and ceremonially decorated yaks with their gleaming, jingling harnesses. In the ensuing decades, I would craft elaborately articulated fantasy trips, incorporating some of all of these exotic components. None of them involved pizza margherita and Tears for Fears on the sound system.\n\nYet that first supper in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\u2019s buzzing and fast-growing capital, augured a journey that while brief \u2013 just four days \u2013 was full of revelatory moments, ones that went to the complicated heart of an enormously beautiful place in great flux. Among my dining companions were Dr Chuluun Togtokh, who chairs Mongolia\u2019s Institute for Sustainable Development and is a globally recognised authority on climate change; his son Mergen Chuluun, a Harvard Business School alumnus, who was, until recently, executive director of the Mongolia Business Council and is CEO of Togtokh Trade, a private consultancy helping local companies achieve goals sustainably; and Ishbaljir Battulga (Ishee to his friends), a tourism operator who co-manages a luxury goods company \u2013 Mongolia\u2019s only locally owned one \u2013 that makes clothing and accessories from the finest goat, yak and baby-camel hair, purchased from nomadic herders. We had been convened by Karina Moreton, an Englishwoman with a passion for the country, who lives a few miles from Chipping Norton, but spends as much time in Mongolia as the exigencies of family life will allow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days she\u2019s deeply concerned with the increasingly precarious state in which both its wilderness and its nomads \u2013 who constitute over a third of the population \u2013 exist, as the effects of climate change are felt with an immediacy and severity that, Togtokh affirms, are among the most conspicuous on the planet. Sustained periods of drought and increasingly severe winters, known as dzuds, have decimated the livestock on which Mongolian herders rely (more than 700,000 animals are estimated to have perished of cold and starvation last winter and a staggering 9.7 million in 2009-10). It\u2019s a terrible conspiracy of warped natural phenomena: the drought makes for poor grazing, so the animals enter the cold months weakened; then unusually extreme temperatures (last January saw them plummet to -43\u00baC) prove too much for them to survive. The result has been a mass human migration off the steppes and into the city: ger districts \u2013 permanent settlements where erstwhile herders have pitched their round felt tents, hoping for a less challenging set of circumstances \u2013 have proliferated in and around Ulaanbaatar. Many are woefully underserviced by plumbing or infrastructure; unemployment is high; and the gers\u2019 coal-burning stoves are the main culprit in the capital\u2019s occasional appalling levels of air pollution.\n\nNow Moreton has set about bringing attention to, and in some small measure mitigating, the problem. This is why I\u2019m here: to be the first to experience a unique tailormade experience she\u2019s piloting through boutique travel designers Cazenove+Loyd called Mandala Mongolia, a high-spec, private, mobile ger camp that can be set up anywhere in the country, from the Altai Mountains in the west to the southern Gobi Desert \u2013 to, in my case, less than 90 minutes\u2019 drive from Ulaanbaatar, on a wildflower-strewn plain not far from Hustai National Park. The location is mostly contingent on clients\u2019 desires, whatever the physical coordinates. However, the idea of Mandala Mongolia is to \u201cshadow\u201d the nomadic families with whom Moreton has cultivated relationships. Its guests, for a few days or weeks, participate in the lives of the herders, observing their routines, walking or riding their land, and hearing, via the translations of a guide and host, their stories.\n\nBut Moreton\u2019s aspirations for the project don\u2019t end there. \u201cWe work with a number of small urban charities that identify families who are \u2018city nomads\u2019 \u2013 ones who\u2019ve suffered major livestock losses and moved to the city, where their hopes for jobs are often not realised,\u201d she says. \u201cOne month\u2019s occupancy of Mandala will fund an entire year of support for such a family to live alongside one of our established families and help with their animals. This family will feed and help reassimilate the \u2018assistant\u2019 nomads; we\u2019ll pay their salary.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an innovative philanthropic model here, to be sure. In the meantime, however, Mandala Mongolia on its own is compelling enough stuff. I departed the elegant surrounds of the Shangri-La Ulaanbaatar around midday with my host guide, Almagul Karagaz, heading west. Within half an hour we were off the highway and onto a rust-hued dirt road, tracing the centre seam of a shallow valley cupped by low granite ridges; the skies overhead, to my delight, were pinpricked with tiny silhouettes of hawks riding on thermals far above us. After another half an hour we began to climb one of the slopes, the dirt trail cresting the summit and following it for a couple of miles, the Land Cruiser vibrating every once in a while in the stiff wind. All around were plains furred with grass and pools of blue-white caryopteris, punctuated every so often in the far distance by a series of bright-white dots \u2013 the gers of herders. Goats, sheep and diminutive, skittish horses, their manes sheared and stiff, were dustings of brown and beige.\n\nEventually, we reached a birch wood, in which was pitched a small tent \u2013 an indulgent lunch stop set up by a few of Mandala\u2019s advance team. We ducked out of the wind and into a wholesome three-course lunch of traditional dumplings, fresh salads and a parfait with a coulis of sea-buckthorn berries, Mongolia\u2019s panacea fruit (Almagul elaborated its salutary elements, most famous among them its vitamin C levels, said to be many times those of oranges). When we emerged, the wind had died down and the temperature was soaring past 30 degrees; we continued along and over the ridge and dipped down onto a wide plain, where Mandala awaited.\n\nThe camp is a thing of quiet excellence, conceived to please both the most adventurous and demanding of Cazenove+Loyd\u2019s clients. That we are squarely in the wilderness is evidenced everywhere \u2013 by the lack of a phone signal, by the patent emptiness of the horizon, by the velvety absoluteness of the darkness once the sun retreats beyond the far hills. But at my disposal are a hot shower and a king-size bed swathed in soft cotton and down and draped in netting; a separate dining and living ger, with a pull-down screen and projector for films, as well as a turntable and a selection of vintage vinyl compilations of classical piano and symphonies (a couple with gorgeous Stalin-era cover designs), and a telescope for stargazing (when Mandala is based this close to Ulaanbaatar, a local astronomy professor can drop by of an evening, given a day\u2019s notice).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are French presses for the coffee, a hammock strung between two birches and four staff, among them a chef who deftly refined Mongolian standards such as beef dumplings in milk tea and stone-grilled mutton khorkhog for an urban palate. The ger\u2019s design hews broadly to tradition \u2013 orange spokes supporting the roof, their azure tips representing the sky; thick felt panels layered between waterproof covers to keep the chill wind at bay; wood chests and armoires painted with floral motifs and containing hot-water bottles and riding chaps, snacks and a handcarved cooler full of local lager and fresh juices.\n\nBelow us on the plain, one of the herder families Moreton has worked with on and off for years has just set up its summer ger. Both with gunmetal-grey hair, Chimeddamba and his wife Tsedeusuren (Chimedee and Tseegii to me) have settled here from May to October for going on 40 years, with a herd of some 600 or 700 animals \u2013 cows, goats, sheep and the small native horses, their manes still long and shaggy after winter \u2013 as well as two sons, now grown. Over cups of boiled-milk tea and tangy sheep curds, Almagul translates as Chimedee describes how their livelihoods \u2013 and lives \u2013 have changed. I comment on the beauty of the landscape, cast in a watercolour of greens. He considers the view. The grass is disappearing faster than usual this year, he says. They\u2019ve had months of drought and already his animals are having to range further to feed. A slim young woman with a gleaming knot of obsidian hair pours us more tea. She is the sister of his daughter-in-law, Chimedee explains, who is looking after the grandchildren while the daughter-in-law teaches at a local village school for the summer. I ask him what he thinks of the Mandala Mongolia reassimilation concept, of \u201ccity\u201d nomads repatriating to his way of life. His face softens, a thousand folds deepening slightly as he produces a faint, possibly cynical, smile. He would welcome the opportunity to help any youngster out of there. But life out here is hard \u2013 harder than it has ever been. He says part of him understands why they move to the city, but he sees how soft they\u2019ve become and wonders if they are strong enough to take up his way of life again.\n\nThe days at Mandala were crafted according to my whims. And as tempting as its indoor environments were, the wide outdoors was the place to be. We visited a nearby camp run by a family that raises yaks, camels and goats, which provide them with both milk for dairy products and indescribably soft \u2013 and valuable \u2013 hair that they gather and sell to clothing manufacturers in Ulaanbaatar. We were served the local spirit of fermented mare\u2019s milk \u2013 surprisingly mild \u2013 by the husband, while his brothers, trained at the national music conservatory, performed traditional throat singing. Both clasped tall horsehead fiddles, drawing long, plaintive notes from them, while the wind sighed in melancholy harmony outside.\n\nIn their quiet fashion, Chimedee and Tseegii welcomed us into their day whenever we ventured down the plain. We strolled with their goats, watched their chestnut stallion chase his mares up the slopes. One morning we helped erect a second ger for Chimedee \u2013 unrolling carpets, beating flat bolts of thick felt, slotting the orange roof spokes into place. Chimedee\u2019s sons nattered and joked, hauling furniture to and fro, admiring ornate silver\u2011studded horse bridles they had unpacked, and comparing the merits of their Russian motorbikes before roaring off on one of them to wrangle a few far-flung animals. And stretching in every direction around the tiny encampment, were the plains, begging exploration on foot or horseback \u2013 a landscape that, bar Chimedee and Tseegii\u2019s camp, was empty as far as the eye could see.\n\nIn the evening back at the camp, sitting with a glass of burgundy and caviar spooned onto the chef\u2019s homemade crisps, I watched the sky fade from washed pink to purple to bruised blue-black, the tiny dots of the few gers below us fading into the darkness, while above, corresponding points of whiteness brightened into recognisable constellations. Here was the inconceivably vast space, the rootless, exotic life on which so many of my fantasies had hinged, all cast in a more complex \u2013 and urgent \u2013 context than I\u2019d foreseen by the Mandala experience.
